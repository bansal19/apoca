[2024-12-17, 6:25:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: this is such a big 180 from “yall are weak lets do this for a full year”

[2024-12-17, 6:30:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It's healthy
[2024-12-17, 6:30:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like I should be flying out to boston for pussy and getting that girl instead of jerking off
[2024-12-17, 6:41:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: i mean, just download tinder or something instead of flying out dude like don’t spend ridiculous amounts on flights for vag

[2024-12-17, 11:21:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: The only indian chick i like ngl
[2024-12-17, 11:21:30 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: She is so fucking hot
[2024-12-17, 11:22:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: have u fucked 1 and 2?
[2024-12-17, 11:22:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: whats her name?
[2024-12-17, 11:22:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No didn't fuck them
[2024-12-17, 11:22:32 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Just made moves and got them setup for sf
[2024-12-17, 11:22:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: have u kissed 1 and 2?
[2024-12-17, 11:22:49 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Kissed one
[2024-12-17, 11:22:53 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Not the other one
[2024-12-17, 11:22:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyyyy lets goooo
[2024-12-17, 11:23:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: mans is actually doing it niiiiice
[2024-12-17, 11:23:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But both were from sf so i was fine sith going slow with them
[2024-12-17, 11:23:35 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: If rhey were only at Neurips then I'd have tried for sure
[2024-12-17, 11:23:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: going slow and roster dont make sense
[2024-12-17, 11:24:00 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Elaborate
[2024-12-17, 11:24:16 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You can just not be exclusive right?
[2024-12-17, 11:24:22 PM] Shardul Bansal: going slow implies u like em, which means u shouldnt try to build a roster
[2024-12-17, 11:24:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I think it makes sense
[2024-12-17, 11:24:31 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Decreases P(doom)
[2024-12-17, 11:24:45 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I disagree
[2024-12-17, 11:24:49 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Even if you like them
[2024-12-17, 11:24:56 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: If they have competition, its better
[2024-12-17, 11:24:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: dude a roster is having 0 feels
[2024-12-17, 11:25:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Idk
[2024-12-17, 11:25:18 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: There's a good middle ground
[2024-12-17, 11:25:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: idk bro ive never done the whole roster shindig, feels wrong imo
[2024-12-17, 11:25:46 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like otherwise if there's not multiple girls, i get too attached
[2024-12-17, 11:26:02 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And then the thing gets fucked because I get too attached
[2024-12-17, 11:26:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: If it's not exclusive then unless they say it's exclusive, no need for it to be
[2024-12-17, 11:26:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: dude its good to get attached, thats attraction, try to see if u can make something real come from it, thats the only relationship that gives pleasure long term
[2024-12-17, 11:26:57 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yeah but when the conversation about exclusivity comes up, you can take care of it then
[2024-12-17, 11:27:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea ig
[2024-12-17, 11:27:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Most people nowadays get too scared of ppl being attached too quickly
[2024-12-17, 11:27:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: not the right person i dont think
[2024-12-17, 11:27:46 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Idk we'll see that later
[2024-12-17, 11:27:53 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I also have never done this roster thing
[2024-12-17, 11:27:58 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: First time but i wanna try
[2024-12-17, 11:28:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I think it'll turn out better
[2024-12-17, 11:28:17 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Let's see what happens
[2024-12-17, 11:28:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: i feel like juggling more than a couple girls is hard work
[2024-12-17, 11:28:38 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Honestly feels easier
[2024-12-17, 11:28:48 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Less headspace, I dont care as much etc
[2024-12-17, 11:28:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: and i dont wanna be part of a girl’s roster either,
[2024-12-17, 11:29:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: nah dude ur gonna care about each one the same
[2024-12-17, 11:29:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I think it's personal preference bro
[2024-12-17, 11:29:37 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: When I was only dating a single chick I definitely cared alot more
[2024-12-17, 11:29:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: let’s see, i wanna know ur findings from the experiment
[2024-12-17, 11:29:48 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes I'll share results
[2024-12-17, 11:29:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: but that’s actually beautiful
[2024-12-17, 11:30:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yeah it is, but at the same time, you'll develop those feelings for someone over a longer period in this way
[2024-12-17, 11:30:40 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And maybe then it'll be even more meaningful because that means you are giving up alot of things for them
[2024-12-17, 11:30:56 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Atleast that's what I think will happen, lets see
[2024-12-17, 11:31:24 PM] Akshay Kashyup: This just turned gay
[2024-12-17, 11:31:47 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It always was
[2024-12-17, 11:32:02 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Read the group name lil bro
[2024-12-17, 11:36:53 PM] Shardul Bansal: dude meaning is derived from beautiful experiences with that person, not because you have to sacrifice time with another girl, this is so obvious
[2024-12-17, 11:37:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yeah true
[2024-12-17, 11:37:41 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But i also think multiple people helps you focus much more on yourself
[2024-12-17, 11:37:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Because your thread is always that you are the main focus
[2024-12-17, 11:38:07 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Idk let's see how this plays out
[2024-12-17, 11:38:27 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I am just trying this because I went all in on the last one and that didn't work out so well
[2024-12-17, 11:38:41 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And I can always go back from this to other format
[2024-12-17, 11:38:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So we'll know
[2024-12-17, 11:38:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: i disagree, depth of a few relationships help u understand urself much better than the breadth of a lot of relationships
[2024-12-17, 11:39:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: but if u want to try the experience out, fuckit
[2024-12-17, 11:39:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro u said u haven't even tried it
[2024-12-17, 11:39:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So how you know
[2024-12-17, 11:39:34 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: We can hypothesize, but we'll never knew w
[2024-12-17, 11:39:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: bro u havent tried gay sex how u know ur not gay
[2024-12-17, 11:40:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: sometimes u just use common sense
[2024-12-17, 11:40:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Well that's a completely different argument
[2024-12-17, 11:40:49 PM] Akshay Kashyup: I mean I guess you understand you understand your hedonistic tendencies better but I fail to see how you get a deeper understanding of yourself with multiple women
[2024-12-17, 11:40:56 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You are just generalizing one arguments example to another one shere it doesn't make sense
[2024-12-17, 11:41:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: ok, fair — but the point remains that depth of a few relationships has helped derive much more happiness for me than breadth over a lot
[2024-12-17, 11:41:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No, I didn't say that, I said you'll focus on yourself more
[2024-12-17, 11:41:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: those relationships are less meaningful
[2024-12-17, 11:41:39 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like focus on self development more

[2025-01-06, 12:02:33 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Too much thinking for the ones you meet elsewhere
[2025-01-06, 12:11:32 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Y'all are way too sensitive like you don't know me 👀

[2025-01-06, 12:41:45 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Yee
[2025-01-06, 12:49:30 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Ok tbf for most of that i was either dating Nina or getting over her
[2025-01-06, 12:49:44 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Since u guys actually want to discuss this horseshit
[2025-01-06, 12:50:27 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I did try talking to a few chicks after that but Nina was always top of mind till early Dec

[2025-01-06, 10:32:03 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Lol it's not like I am lying to you, it's more like saying that I am over her would've actually helped with it. Atleast in these kinds of things it does. Fake it till you make it works

[2025-01-06, 7:41:15 PM] Akshay Kashyup: One achievement at a time
[2025-01-06, 7:41:29 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I was hoping to go on a date, fuck with all that energy but alas the date itself played me
[2025-01-06, 7:41:54 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Need to hop back on creatine, twas was godmode
[2025-01-06, 7:46:27 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Idk dude situations like that I feel it’s better to just be an observer and go “huh weird how this turned out and how the other person behaved, what’s up here?” rather than take that personally as you being played or a negative signal about you
[2025-01-06, 7:47:04 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Oh no, I didn't take it as anything negative about me
[2025-01-06, 7:47:14 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And/or about them
[2025-01-06, 7:47:26 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: More like i just really wanted to fuck lol

[2025-01-06, 7:48:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But if I don't put effort in in my mid 20s then when
[2025-01-06, 7:50:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I might be done with trying to date atleast for this month 😤
[2025-01-06, 11:04:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: preach dawg, stay positive
[2025-01-06, 11:04:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: akshaj ur a pendulum swinging from corner to corner

[2025-01-06, 11:11:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No we'll do marina, just dating is too much time consumption

[2025-01-08, 2:02:32 AM] Akshay Kashyup: This one kid gave a presentation about his drones at SPC. Told him I’d angel invest immediately after
[2025-01-08, 2:02:45 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Idk about that but def time to invest here

[2025-01-08, 2:03:01 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Get me in brother
[2025-01-08, 2:04:20 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Low cost high altitude drones to compete with $100mn reaper drones. They’ve already built the best in class 5k feet altitude drones from their apartment here (with custom weaved carbon fiber and ML). They’re going for 35k feet
[2025-01-08, 2:04:52 AM] Akshay Kashyup: I’ll connect you. Dude is cracked in every sense of the word. Technical and business chops

[2025-01-08, 2:15:07 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So maybe I should just lock in, build, sell, raise, get acquired
[2025-01-08, 2:16:45 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Man akshay do me a solid and bring some food back
[2025-01-08, 2:16:48 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Please th

[2025-01-08, 2:26:21 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: O noice
[2025-01-08, 2:26:42 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But the problem is these indian vcs rarely invest in deeptech
[2025-01-08, 2:26:53 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I've only seen pixxel
[2025-01-08, 2:27:16 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I am trying to convert prompt engineering from an art to a science using interpretability
[2025-01-08, 2:27:33 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Everyone even at the big cos is doing manual tuning apparently
[2025-01-08, 2:27:58 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But I am unsure if I want to get back in the startup life
[2025-01-08, 2:28:05 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Earning money was kinda nice
[2025-01-08, 2:35:43 AM] Akshay Kashyup: It’s changing. Had a conversation with Prateek about this earlier.
[2025-01-08, 2:36:04 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: O nice yeah that'd be sick
[2025-01-08, 2:36:22 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: If India actually does deeptech

[2025-01-08, 2:42:04 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I am craving Indian food so bad rn holy shit
[2025-01-08, 2:42:30 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You know how you are craving girls on day 15 of no nut -> I am craving Indian food to that extent
[2025-01-08, 2:43:15 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Gotcha. Would you like restate a prompt so it’s optimal for the model?
[2025-01-08, 2:43:25 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Go to San Jose
[2025-01-08, 2:43:51 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: That's the final aim, but a middle aim is that the user understands how changing the prompt is changing model behaviors thoroughly
[2025-01-08, 2:43:57 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like how are the latents changing
[2025-01-08, 2:44:58 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Basically people can only optimize prompts right now given evals are rigid, but in alot of these case evals are changing and dynamic, so it would be helpful for them to them understanding of what's actually happening in models
[2025-01-08, 2:46:43 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I will this weekend
[2025-01-08, 2:46:49 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But i might die before then

[2025-01-09, 2:21:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: if u asked her out and she wasnt about it, then its not a date
[2025-01-09, 2:22:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: im down to do twice a month, got that going with a couple other homies

[2025-02-18, 6:11:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Dude we should make the china coin @16472039624
[2025-02-18, 6:11:35 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Or actually another subnet, I am down to reiterate
[2025-02-18, 6:11:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: @15183477667 that’s the benedikt we met from princeton
[2025-02-18, 6:12:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: i’m not down to do this
[2025-02-18, 6:12:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: We can name it niggacoin
[2025-02-18, 6:12:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: fuck why does that go so hard
[2025-02-18, 6:13:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: i’m down to keep thinking of subnet ideas, i’m likely doing that next after releasing what we build, thinking about leaving my job in May if the next proj isn’t super interesting
[2025-02-18, 6:14:36 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Oh dang he did seem nice
[2025-02-18, 6:14:50 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: What if we give manual reward signals using a distributed net for GRPO stuff
[2025-02-18, 6:15:13 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like some rewards are computer generatable but some aren't
[2025-02-18, 6:15:30 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So for the ones that aren't we just give people coins to human label them
[2025-02-18, 6:16:07 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro the v7 is such a chef's kiss
[2025-02-18, 6:16:07 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Bro rediscovered mechanical Turk
[2025-02-18, 6:16:16 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But web3
[2025-02-18, 6:16:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: xD
[2025-02-18, 6:17:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: that’s not a bad idea, you’re saying reward people for doing giving rlhf data?
[2025-02-18, 6:17:59 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Not rlhf, GRPO
[2025-02-18, 6:18:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But you get the vibe
[2025-02-18, 6:19:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But as Akshay is saying the only concern is that the traditional data collection peoplz will also do this
[2025-02-18, 6:19:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And not distributed - so maybe that will be better
[2025-02-18, 6:19:30 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And also cheaper
[2025-02-18, 6:20:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Basically I don't see a usecase where distirbuted is better than centralized except regulatory freedom aka chinacoin
[2025-02-18, 6:20:25 PM] Akshay Kashyup: I mean, what’s the difference between rewards for RLHF va GRPO? Afaik its the same rewards but they’re different ways of utilizing the rewards
[2025-02-18, 6:21:00 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No it's a lil diff RLHF you rank stuff GRPO you give it a score aka reward signal
[2025-02-18, 6:21:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Independent of other generations IMO
[2025-02-18, 6:21:34 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: GRPO is closer to true RL
[2025-02-18, 6:21:43 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But yes vibes are similar
[2025-02-18, 6:22:28 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Horrible business. So boring. You guys are built for more ambitious ideas
[2025-02-18, 6:23:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: no dude it’s actually a great idea
[2025-02-18, 6:23:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I just want more Monei I am cooked
[2025-02-18, 6:23:30 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Fuck the world  - give me the monei
[2025-02-18, 6:23:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: You build chain of thought reasoning models for every enterprise use case by getting miners to do the GRPO for u
[2025-02-18, 6:23:35 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I believe in capitalism
[2025-02-18, 6:24:04 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Actually not entirely
[2025-02-18, 6:24:08 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I akso want power
[2025-02-18, 6:24:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes accurate, but basically distributed would not really help here
[2025-02-18, 6:24:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: i don’t want Akshaj to have power
[2025-02-18, 6:24:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: why not
[2025-02-18, 6:24:47 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It doesn't add anything
[2025-02-18, 6:24:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: can we parrallelize
[2025-02-18, 6:25:08 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You can hire these workers in a centralized system without the bittensor emissions and validators and it'll be less expensive
[2025-02-18, 6:25:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And human labeling is a efficiency/cheapness game
[2025-02-18, 6:25:28 PM] Akshay Kashyup: is your value prop so great that businesses will want to use you instead of Scale?
[2025-02-18, 6:25:40 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Are you going to outcompete them on price?
[2025-02-18, 6:25:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes bro scale sucks for this stuff bro
[2025-02-18, 6:25:59 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: All these model cos are not using scale anyways
[2025-02-18, 6:26:06 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You can go to reddit and see outlier.ai etc
[2025-02-18, 6:26:10 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Invisible
[2025-02-18, 6:26:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: we can, we can raise and subsidize based on emissions
[2025-02-18, 6:26:27 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And now with GRPO/RL you need more specialized RL systems too
[2025-02-18, 6:26:55 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Hmm like crowdsourcing subject matter expertise
[2025-02-18, 6:26:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And scale focuses on low quality/cheap labour
[2025-02-18, 6:27:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: For a lot of these you need high quality labour
[2025-02-18, 6:27:10 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Which is paid more/hour
[2025-02-18, 6:27:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: There's some cos in the space
[2025-02-18, 6:27:28 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like Pareto
[2025-02-18, 6:27:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: do u need a labelled dataset for GRPO, how does it work, is it similar to SFT
[2025-02-18, 6:27:39 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Yeah I guess that can be a differentiator
[2025-02-18, 6:28:28 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Pareto.ai is similar
[2025-02-18, 6:28:33 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No
[2025-02-18, 6:28:41 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: SFT is very different than GRPO
[2025-02-18, 6:28:52 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: GRPO is basically RL with a reward signal
[2025-02-18, 6:28:58 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Self reimprovement type stuff
[2025-02-18, 6:29:06 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Given a reward function
[2025-02-18, 6:29:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: how is the reward signal determined, what would a miner be doing in this case
[2025-02-18, 6:30:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: That's the thing reward signal normally for some cases like formatting is computer generated and that works
[2025-02-18, 6:30:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But for other cases you need humans
[2025-02-18, 6:30:27 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: High quality humans to give reward signals distributed
[2025-02-18, 6:30:50 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Idk if bittensor is the best way but I remember you said there's some subnetwork that allows people to send prompts
[2025-02-18, 6:31:10 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And the better the prompt you get more monei or whatever
[2025-02-18, 6:31:19 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So similarly, here you just send a reward signal
[2025-02-18, 6:31:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: hmnnn yea, if u need humans why wouldn’t u just use scale.ai for this, and also too much manual effort for it to be a good subnet
[2025-02-18, 6:31:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: unless we’re working on the formatting part but that’s not a big enough problem
[2025-02-18, 6:31:43 PM] Akshay Kashyup: How do you verify the people on the subnet are high quality? Since they’re anon
[2025-02-18, 6:31:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Scale ai is Filipino labour bro this requires quality humans
[2025-02-18, 6:32:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes this idk
[2025-02-18, 6:32:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: ya this ^^
[2025-02-18, 6:32:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But I assumed theres a human subnet support system too if this is happening ^
[2025-02-18, 6:33:06 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: We give them some gradings we already know answers to and have validators validate the scores?
[2025-02-18, 6:33:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: nahh, no miner is doing manual work, it’s all automated, dataset curation/model training/fine-tuning, other post-training shit
[2025-02-18, 6:33:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: or even just simple RAG
[2025-02-18, 6:33:51 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Ohk
[2025-02-18, 6:33:54 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Hmm
[2025-02-18, 6:34:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Then we can create GRPO rewards systems
[2025-02-18, 6:34:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: For specific usecases?
[2025-02-18, 6:34:36 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Which use web search etc
[2025-02-18, 6:36:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So they can use da miners etc
[2025-02-18, 6:37:09 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I just fail to see why people wouldn't do this inhouse
[2025-02-18, 6:38:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: because they failed to do data annotation and labelling in house, no one wants to do work that’s not immediately profitable
[2025-02-18, 6:38:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: what do u mean
[2025-02-18, 6:38:47 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No I mean synthetic data pipelines bro
[2025-02-18, 6:38:53 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Not the labelling stuff
[2025-02-18, 6:39:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Synthetic data pipelines probably inhouse at alot of these companies
[2025-02-18, 6:39:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: even synth data pipelines, idk if theyre gonna do that man
[2025-02-18, 6:39:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: thats the bet that bespoke labs is making
[2025-02-18, 6:40:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: What if we make a system to find the best GRPO reward mechanisms/GRPO reward signals
[2025-02-18, 6:40:36 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Also I’m not entirely sure the rewards are different for GRPO. You have the human preferences/ranking for both PPO and GRPO, and a reward model trained similarly used in both afaik. The way the reward is used is different - PPO has a critic model which predicts the expected reward and GRPO doesn’t
[2025-02-18, 6:41:28 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I don't think deepseek's GRPO had human preferences
[2025-02-18, 6:41:43 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It was a reward signal based on formatting n correctness etc
[2025-02-18, 6:44:50 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/does-deepseek-s-grpo-use-human-MLVK3ZZsRXOg.EvLhvEqOg
[2025-02-18, 6:44:56 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Right. Computationally generated reward.
[2025-02-18, 6:45:23 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Yeah I shouldn’t say human. But some kind of preference/ranking
[2025-02-18, 6:47:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yeah but basically that's a huge difference from rlhf
[2025-02-18, 6:47:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Because that inevitably makes it hard to scale rlhf
[2025-02-18, 6:47:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: What i am saying is can we spin up an automated system to discover the best computer generated reward signal
‎[2025-02-18, 7:01:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: ‎image omitted
[2025-02-18, 7:02:29 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Probably not bro
[2025-02-18, 7:02:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But i haven't read how they did it yet
[2025-02-19, 1:07:56 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: How about distributed GRPO for SLMs for data engineering
[2025-02-19, 1:15:21 PM] Akshay Kashyup: SLM = small language model?
[2025-02-19, 1:16:09 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes
[2025-02-19, 1:16:17 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Because you need low cost n high thoroughput
[2025-02-19, 1:16:27 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: When you are doing gigabyte datasets through LLMs
[2025-02-19, 1:16:59 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Why data engineering specifically?
[2025-02-19, 1:17:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: This
[2025-02-19, 1:17:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I fhink it's a very good usecase for specialized llms
[2025-02-19, 1:17:35 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like imagine spark type calls but unstructured -> structured
[2025-02-19, 1:17:38 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Extraction
[2025-02-19, 1:17:38 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Like you mean to reason and help with writing data engineering code?
[2025-02-19, 1:17:45 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: A d easy to GRPO it too
[2025-02-19, 1:17:47 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No
[2025-02-19, 1:17:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: This
[2025-02-19, 1:19:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: i thought grpo can’t be automated
[2025-02-19, 1:19:30 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Grpo is automated
[2025-02-19, 1:19:38 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It depends on the reward signal
[2025-02-19, 1:19:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: U can have a human reward signal too
[2025-02-19, 1:19:57 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But mostly it was a automated reward signal
[2025-02-19, 1:20:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: i need to read about grpo
[2025-02-19, 1:20:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: i don’t know how it works
[2025-02-19, 1:23:00 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I was doing this for my project, but at a large scale the large models are too expensive
[2025-02-19, 1:23:14 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And I think the task is simple enough for SLMs that are tuned for this ngl
[2025-02-19, 5:21:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: gg bois
[2025-02-19, 5:21:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: time to gtfo

[2025-02-20, 8:25:15 AM] Akshay Kashyup: subnet for better GPU kernels/drivers/compilers
[2025-02-20, 9:34:54 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Akshay Might have cooked
[2025-02-20, 9:36:27 AM] Akshay Kashyup: 😳
[2025-02-20, 9:37:06 AM] Akshay Kashyup: I’m just a monkey Shakespeare sim bro I throw words together till they make sense
[2025-02-20, 9:38:05 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: By sakana ai
[2025-02-20, 9:38:05 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Did you see the release yesterday?
[2025-02-20, 9:38:08 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: @16472039624 watcha think of this bro lets do it
[2025-02-20, 9:38:15 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Then we sell the kernels to the highest bidder
[2025-02-20, 9:38:24 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Or use it in our net
[2025-02-20, 12:42:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Looping in AI (An Indian) into AI systems is a 400 IQ move
[2025-02-20, 2:44:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: bro this shit hard af
[2025-02-20, 2:44:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: but deepseek did it to get more gains, there were optimisations to be made
[2025-02-20, 2:45:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: is it true that GPU hardware between AMD and nvidia is the same? i thought amd hardware doesn’t compare at all, they can’t do anything below 7 nm
[2025-02-20, 2:47:29 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: ??
[2025-02-20, 2:47:40 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Not that hard read sakana's new paper
[2025-02-20, 2:47:43 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Also verifiable
[2025-02-20, 2:47:47 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So we only need compute
[2025-02-20, 2:48:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Akshay is saying an AI will make optimizations
[2025-02-20, 2:48:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like this: https://pub.sakana.ai/ai-cuda-engineer
[2025-02-20, 2:48:45 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Its not the same, but similar in capability yes, most of NVIDIA moat is software connections
[2025-02-20, 2:51:04 PM] Akshay Kashyup: AMD hardware is actually great. Their software is shit
[2025-02-20, 2:51:29 PM] Akshay Kashyup: There’s whole beef with tinygrad
[2025-02-20, 2:51:41 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Yeah. Easily verifiable
[2025-02-20, 2:55:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: fuck
[2025-02-20, 2:55:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: great idea
[2025-02-20, 2:55:49 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Seems like there's a benchmark too: https://scalingintelligence.stanford.edu/blogs/kernelbench/#:~:text=TL;DR,programming%20and%20ML%20system%20optimization.
[2025-02-20, 2:55:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: llm based cuda optimisations
[2025-02-20, 2:59:07 PM] Akshay Kashyup: you could do this for any domain that uses kernels I guess. Input -> Output, verifiable, peformance measurable. Like the Goat Carmack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8u_k2LIZyo
[2025-02-20, 2:59:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: holy shit Akshay
[2025-02-20, 2:59:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: this is a great idea
[2025-02-20, 2:59:54 PM] Akshay Kashyup: They dont make em like they used to anymore so low level optimization will be a trend that dies with the old heads. Revive it
[2025-02-20, 3:00:38 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: U read this bro @15183477667 ?
[2025-02-20, 3:00:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: GPU kernels are all the rage — we don’t even have to come up with any optimisations, we just come up with benchmarks and give that to validators, the miners do all the heavy lifting.
[2025-02-20, 3:00:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: We can also make Nvidia software for AMD - verifiable
[2025-02-20, 3:16:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://celiumcompute.ai/
[2025-02-20, 3:16:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: this is the compute rental marketplace on bittensor
[2025-02-20, 3:18:06 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Lets do it?
[2025-02-20, 3:18:06 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Cuda AI engineer subnet
[2025-02-20, 3:18:40 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Chinacompute lfg
[2025-02-20, 3:25:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: i’m connected to the guy who runs this subnet, he’s getting 5.6% emissions on his subnet rn which is like 12 mil in emissions alone annually
[2025-02-20, 3:26:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: gonna ask why he’s so valuable
[2025-02-20, 3:39:23 PM] Akshay Kashyup: This is very cool. Feels like as a byproduct, you could build a public, decentralized version of that "innovation archive"
[2025-02-20, 3:50:56 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Another application of this could be for Linux kernels - there's a shortage of experienced low-level code maintainers, loss of tribal knowledge, fewer students focusing on OS work: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/is-there-a-shortage-of-linux-k-H.KofOJ7SnqO0GI0yM80sA

Building an innovation archive could be useful
[2025-02-20, 4:01:44 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Let's create the same subnet but market it in china
[2025-02-20, 4:01:46 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Even more monei
[2025-02-22, 8:17:37 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Guys

[2025-02-26, 3:05:28 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So probably abandoning devrel and just doing this
[2025-02-26, 3:05:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Also easy to get customers in this and they really want the product
[2025-02-26, 3:05:45 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like it's insane

[2025-02-26, 3:06:54 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: like information retrieval etc

[2025-02-26, 3:07:46 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: it’s cooking but basically embedding models with system prompts
[2025-02-26, 3:07:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: without datasets
[2025-02-26, 3:08:02 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: /finetune embeddings w/o datasets
[2025-02-26, 3:10:18 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: that’s one part of this, but I think I got a good narrative across the stack
[2025-02-26, 3:10:30 PM] Akshay Kashyup: You are a helpful startup founder. Please state your pitch with the following structure:
<Problem>
<Current Solutions>
<Proposed new solution>
[2025-02-26, 3:10:31 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: also basically no good way to do automated search infra by default
[2025-02-26, 3:11:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It’s complex if you don’t get it from this, i’ll have to spend too much time explaining unless you already know the search infra stack and where people are using search/RAG
[2025-02-26, 3:14:52 PM] Akshay Kashyup: What is “embedding models with prompts”? You want to generate embedding for tokens that don’t have em using prompts?

[2025-03-01, 9:17:27 AM] Akshay Kashyup: Schrodingers Banger dawg. It’s both a banger and not until you tweet it out
[2025-03-01, 9:17:48 AM] Akshay Kashyup: A search engine? Competing with perplexity?
[2025-03-01, 9:24:14 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No bro search infra
[2025-03-01, 9:28:49 AM] Akshay Kashyup: For companies to spin up their own search engines?
[2025-03-01, 9:30:38 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No bro for ai agents
[2025-03-01, 9:30:43 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Search infra for ai agents
[2025-03-01, 9:30:50 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Also I have better embedding models for search
[2025-03-01, 10:15:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: we should hop on a call, this is some vague ass shit akshaj
[2025-03-01, 10:15:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: like headless browsers?
[2025-03-01, 10:19:18 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro it's just search infra holy fuck
[2025-03-01, 10:19:22 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Let me cook first
[2025-03-01, 10:19:38 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Once it ends up cooking I'll give u website link

[2025-03-02, 11:09:53 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Coz the phone call went on for 4 hours
[2025-03-02, 11:09:59 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: That means homie is always cooked
[2025-03-02, 11:10:02 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Whenever that happens
[2025-03-02, 11:10:08 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bad signal
[2025-03-03, 3:26:01 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Harvey agreed to test my method on internal evals
[2025-03-03, 3:26:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But can't sell to them because they need only azure processors
[2025-03-03, 3:26:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: As a guarantee
[2025-03-03, 9:01:12 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Only if you paid for it

[2025-03-03, 9:01:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Lmao no bro
[2025-03-03, 9:06:34 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I also found a way to make a faster vector DB
[2025-03-03, 9:06:38 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: With my embeddings
[2025-03-03, 9:06:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Gged
[2025-03-03, 9:06:59 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I basically have the fastest semantic search possible
[2025-03-03, 9:11:29 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Say more?
[2025-03-03, 9:12:13 PM] Akshay Kashyup: What’s the current SOTA that you’re competing against?
[2025-03-03, 9:13:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Normal dense embeddings vectorDBs
[2025-03-03, 9:13:25 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: My algo+search allows faster semantic search than anything else
[2025-03-03, 9:13:37 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I am not counting BM25 in semantic search since it's word based
[2025-03-03, 9:17:51 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Do you have a faster nearest neighbor search algo or is it more of an infra optimization? ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-03-03, 9:19:45 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: yes faster search algo
[2025-03-03, 9:21:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: But it only works with my embeddings model
[2025-03-03, 9:21:51 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So maybe I'll serve them as a package
[2025-03-03, 9:21:56 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Jeez Louise

[2025-03-03, 9:27:16 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Might be best option tbf
[2025-03-03, 9:33:39 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Do you really need seed rn?
[2025-03-03, 9:34:00 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No but it'll make it easier to get acquired quicker

[2025-03-08, 5:20:01 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I discovered my search is the fastest, least expensive, computationally less expensive, less storage required
[2025-03-08, 5:20:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: In the semantic search domain*
[2025-03-08, 5:39:53 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Can you like say more so we can share your excitement
[2025-03-08, 5:40:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro that's all there is to it
[2025-03-08, 5:40:21 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: My embeddings+vectorDB= Speed itself
[2025-03-08, 5:40:23 PM] Akshay Kashyup: So it’s embeddings and cosine distance?
[2025-03-08, 5:40:32 PM] Akshay Kashyup: What’s different about your embeddings?
[2025-03-08, 5:40:55 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro that's a trade secret
[2025-03-08, 5:41:44 PM] Akshay Kashyup: I mean I get that, but what embeddings are these? Token embeddings? Sentence/phrase embeddings?
[2025-03-08, 5:42:12 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Oh yeah semantic embeddings which capture the whole meaning
[2025-03-08, 5:42:34 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Of what? Of a document? Of a sentence?
[2025-03-08, 5:42:50 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Anything bro just like how other embeddings work
[2025-03-08, 5:43:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like how the OpenAI type shit works
[2025-03-08, 5:43:41 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Ok. So you built a whole new embedding model?
[2025-03-08, 5:43:46 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yes
[2025-03-08, 5:43:58 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: And also horizontally integrated it with vectorDB
[2025-03-08, 5:44:07 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: So my vectorDB+embeddings is fastest
[2025-03-08, 5:44:38 PM] Akshay Kashyup: You built a whole new vectorDB system too? Like a C library?
[2025-03-08, 5:45:00 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No, I modified the open source ones so they work with mine very well
[2025-03-08, 5:45:05 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I am not a retard
[2025-03-08, 5:45:17 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Work with my embeddings*
[2025-03-08, 5:45:27 PM] Akshay Kashyup: Why would that be being a retard?
[2025-03-08, 5:45:42 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Too much effort for something that's not required
[2025-03-08, 5:45:56 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: You can make most algo changes in open source vectorDB libs/add stuff easy
[2025-03-08, 5:46:16 PM] Akshay Kashyup: You modified pgvector?
[2025-03-08, 5:47:10 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I am not going into more lower level detail

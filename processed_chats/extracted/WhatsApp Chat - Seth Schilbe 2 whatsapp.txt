[2022-01-08, 10:22:31 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yo Seth, morning bud! So I was working out yesterday and I fucked up my back lifting without proper equipment. I’m still able to move around no problem but maybe giving it a rest might be better. I’d prefer Friday this week to head to whistler if it’s all the same?
[2022-01-08, 10:27:57 AM] Seth Schilbe: Oh shit man I'm so sorry to hear about your back! Yeah definitely give it some rest! 

I'm actually oncall on Friday, traded a  day with Dustin to help him out while he is living out of a hotel 😬

Lets plan for Monday the 17th? 😂
[2022-01-08, 11:05:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ok, ok, what about Wednesday? Or is the middle of the week not great??
[2022-01-08, 11:08:31 AM] Seth Schilbe: I have an on-call shift this Tuesday->Thursday 😂 so basically this coming week other Monday is a no go for me.

Also have to figure out when Meah is working the following week cause otherwise I won't have a car 😬
[2022-01-08, 12:44:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ahhhh yeah ok, honestly my back is already better, I’ll be good to ski Monday
[2022-01-08, 12:44:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: Kinda wanna get started on that ASAP, super excited to hit the slopes
[2022-01-08, 12:48:29 PM] Seth Schilbe: I'm hoping snow here means even more snow in Whistler! 🤞Keep me posted how your back is feeling tomorrow and if you aren't up to it we can always reschedule 😁
[2022-01-08, 3:01:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perfect, let’s assume it’s a yes for Monday

[2023-03-03, 10:39:30 PM] Seth Schilbe: Haha glad to hear! Just let me know when you guys are up and moving tomorrow 😂
[2023-03-04, 8:15:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m up but the rest of the peeps are still sleeping
[2023-03-04, 8:41:23 AM] Seth Schilbe: Any idea what you guys are doing today? Going for a hike or something?
[2023-03-04, 8:48:30 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea I was suggesting that, didn’t really know if anyone else was down though as soon as I figure it out, I’ll let you know
[2023-03-04, 8:49:13 AM] Seth Schilbe: Sounds good! How was sleeping in a tent last night? Warm enough? 😂
[2023-03-04, 9:09:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yeah, honestly wasn’t bad had a pretty good sleep! I think the folks are down for a hike. Let me know when you want to come through. We can all go together.
[2023-03-04, 9:11:58 AM] Seth Schilbe: Sounds good, just having a bite to eat then I'll head out. Says I'm about an hour to get to you so should be there around 10:30
[2023-03-04, 9:55:07 AM] Shardul Bansal: When you get to the campground, we’ll be on campsite 10

[2023-03-06, 6:41:31 AM] Seth Schilbe: Going to work from the office today, which office are you planning to work out of? 😁
[2023-03-06, 7:10:07 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh sweet, let’s do YVR11?
[2023-03-06, 7:10:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: Or wanna do 14?
[2023-03-06, 7:10:30 AM] Seth Schilbe: 11 works for me!
[2023-03-06, 7:10:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: Just synthesizing some pipelines rn 👀
[2023-03-06, 7:11:09 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll do a quick ab workout and join
[2023-03-06, 9:47:58 PM] Seth Schilbe: Hey dude, not sure if you have plans tomorrow but Daniel is going to be done work around 7pm and we were going to hit the pool/hot tub at his hotel and hangout for the evening if you are free and want to join!
[2023-03-06, 10:54:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oooooh ok, thanks for the invite G, I’ll let you know tomorrow morning if that’s cool? 👍
[2023-03-06, 10:55:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: How was your eve with him?
[2023-03-07, 6:58:26 AM] Seth Schilbe: Ya no worries! Was good, always nice to catch up with him. We weren't out super late, I was home before 9:30 😂
[2023-03-07, 9:41:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m in let’s do it G! I’ll see you at the office today?
[2023-03-07, 9:46:39 AM] Seth Schilbe: Working from home today. Going to hit the gym and have dinner with Meah before I head downtown this evening
[2023-03-07, 3:09:39 PM] Seth Schilbe: Daniel just messaged me and said he probably won't be done work until like 8-9pm tonight so probably going to skip coming downtown. I'll let you know if things change though!
[2023-03-07, 3:10:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ahhh ok, thanks for letting me know. I’ll see you Friday morning tho anyway!
[2023-03-08, 11:12:02 AM] Shardul Bansal: https://youtu.be/II03SfoHaic
[2023-03-08, 11:12:13 AM] Shardul Bansal: Just had a meeting with Anbo and this is how I felt ^
[2023-03-08, 11:54:16 AM] Seth Schilbe: I was thinking about this the last time I talked to him 🤣
[2023-03-09, 12:39:25 PM] Seth Schilbe: What time you want to hit the road tomorrow? Anything you need me to bring?

Was thinking the easiest thing is probably for me to take an EVO and meet you at Park Royal or something so I don't have to try and drive downtown on a Friday morning 🤣
[2023-03-09, 1:17:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ooooh ok, yea sure that might make sense yea. The slopes open at 8:30, should we try to get there by 8 so Conor can rent the skis and piss himself with enough time for us to actually start early? 

I think I can pick you up at 6:45! Also, if downtown is more convenient for you, there shouldn’t be any traffic that early in the morning, either option works for me tho
[2023-03-09, 1:19:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also, would you happen to have extra gloves? Conor doesn’t have any and I only have my one pair. I’m sure we can also ask Caroline but I don’t want to bug her family early in the morning
[2023-03-09, 1:21:58 PM] Seth Schilbe: Ya fair enough, I'll just drive to yours then!

I do not have an extra pair of gloves 😬
[2023-03-09, 5:37:22 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyyuuup! Also! While coming down, do you want to stop by BeachHouse in dundarave for dinner? Get Meah out there as well! We can do a little dinner and then a catan sesh at Caroline’s if y’all are down!
[2023-03-09, 5:56:48 PM] Seth Schilbe: Ya I am down! Meah will probably be a game time decision on Saturday 😂 I'll ask her if maybe she wants to even do something with Caroline during the afternoon or something!
[2023-03-09, 10:07:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: You’re gonna love the car we got for our rental
[2023-03-09, 10:59:29 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lol what is it? 😂
[2023-03-09, 11:26:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: you’ll see
[2023-03-09, 11:26:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll see you tomorrow at 6:45 G!
[2023-03-10, 6:14:09 AM] Seth Schilbe: Going to be closer to 7, ended up with a ghost Evo and have to walk 10 minutes to the next 🙄
[2023-03-10, 6:27:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: np Conor’s peeing rn so he won’t have to at Whistler
[2023-03-10, 6:54:22 AM] Seth Schilbe: 5 minutes
[2023-03-10, 8:50:14 PM] Seth Schilbe: I love http://trueclassictees.com! Shop through my link to get a reward http://rwrd.io/pgdnkwp?s
[2023-03-15, 5:44:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yoooyoyooo so tell me how Kitchener was before you got to the farm 👀
[2023-03-15, 5:44:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: Did things go well with Alex ahahaha
[2023-03-15, 5:50:59 PM] Seth Schilbe: Bro my flight was delayed by 6 hours 🤣 I didn't land until 2am and my dad just ended up coming to get me from the airport. Might see her for dinner on Monday but otherwise she's busy all week
[2023-03-15, 7:01:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: Daaaamn right right that’s tough to hear man honestly who knows what’ll happen when you see her again 🤷‍♂️ I
[2023-03-15, 7:04:20 PM] Seth Schilbe: Yes we will just have to see!
[2023-03-26, 7:22:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayuuuup Seth! Wanna ski on Sunday?
[2023-03-26, 7:38:23 PM] Seth Schilbe: Hey hey! Unfortunately I am oncall this weekend 🙄 free next weekend though!
[2023-03-26, 8:12:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: diggity damnnnnn ok got another plan, wanna come chill for the day where Meah and Caroline can study, maybe you and I can game and then we can go out for some dinner and catan sesh?
[2023-03-26, 8:12:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: The weekend after sounds good, let’s do it!
[2023-03-27, 2:05:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh shoot I’m oncall then 😔
[2023-03-27, 2:07:43 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lol of course 😅 the weekend after that then? 

You free for dinner/drinks on Thursday this week?
[2023-03-27, 2:40:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Shoot no can’t do on Thursday, how’s Friday?
[2023-03-27, 2:41:15 PM] Seth Schilbe: Plans with Meah on Friday 🤣 how about tomorrow?
[2023-03-27, 4:48:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Tomorrows good let’s do it hahahaha

[2023-03-28, 8:48:59 AM] Shardul Bansal: sweet, I’ll be there in around an hour
[2023-03-30, 9:20:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: Morning man, how are you doing?
[2023-03-30, 9:27:40 AM] Seth Schilbe: Morning dude, feeling alright! Definitely think I was on a bit of an adrenaline high last night with everything going on...

Had a little chat with Meah last night, I think her and I are all good.

Decided this morning I am just going to put it on the back burner until this weekend and spend some time on Saturday figuring out what next steps are
[2023-03-30, 9:28:17 AM] Seth Schilbe: Really appreciate you checking up on me ❤️
[2023-03-30, 9:33:09 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ok that’s good to hear, it must’ve been a pretty big scare to see the popo at the door, I can imagine that must’ve resulted in a pretty big fight or flight response 😅

Good to know you and Meah are doing well, again, if you wanna talk man I’m here 🙏
[2023-04-01, 9:14:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yo wanna watch the race at the office tomorrow??
[2023-04-01, 9:20:02 PM] Seth Schilbe: Ya that sounds like a good idea!
[2023-04-03, 8:40:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: Did you get the pancake recipe?
[2023-04-03, 8:43:17 PM] Seth Schilbe: Yes 😂 Meah and I were chatting and I said "I am 99% confident I am no longer oncall" 🤣

[2023-04-19, 8:30:34 AM] Seth Schilbe: Hahaha it was good, followed your advice 😜
[2023-04-19, 8:31:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: Wowowow full honesty and just told her you’re in a open relationship?
[2023-04-19, 8:34:53 AM] Seth Schilbe: Haha no, the other advice about laying some pipe 🤣🤣

I barely said anything about me, she was happy to just talk and let me ask questions so 😂
[2023-04-19, 8:36:55 AM] Shardul Bansal: Woahhh FUCK ME you laid pipe on the first date??

[2023-04-19, 8:41:25 AM] Seth Schilbe: Before 11. Went for drinks for a couple of hours, walked around downtown, then went back to her place in Burnaby 😁
[2023-05-02, 10:30:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yo I have the “party room” booked at my place this Friday, wanna grab some dinner after paintball and then have some drinks over at mine this Friday? Definitely meahs still invited but don’t think Caroline will be able to make it. Was thinking of opening the invite up to Cathal and Tony as well!
[2023-05-03, 7:47:15 AM] Seth Schilbe: Yes sounds like a great time! I'll let Meah know but I'm sure she'll appreciate the night in by herself 😅
[2023-05-03, 9:31:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: Sweet, Tony’s in as well
[2023-05-03, 9:31:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: Also imma ask Jin!

[2023-05-08, 8:52:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: Duuuude thank you for the date idea, went to ripples winery and then the Abbotsford tulip festival yesterday, was a fantastic day out with Caroline, she loved it!
[2023-05-08, 8:53:15 AM] Shardul Bansal: How was camping? Tryna do it again this weekend? It’s supposed to be AMAZING weather
[2023-05-08, 8:54:06 AM] Seth Schilbe: That's awesome! Glad you guys had a great day out 😁

You going to be in the office today? Going to be in around 10am (downtown for an appointment)
[2023-05-08, 8:54:12 AM] Shardul Bansal: We’ve got 8 campsites out at Golden Ears provincial park! we’re thinking of driving up on Saturday and spending the night there, doing a couple hikes on Sunday and driving back downtown. Are you in or are you guys not here then?
[2023-05-08, 8:54:24 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, I’ll make my way in 🫡
[2023-05-08, 8:54:26 AM] Seth Schilbe: Camping was great! Meah and I are in Whistler for our anniversary this weekend so no camping 😅

Glad to hear you guys had a great weekend, look forward to all the ridiculous stories 😜

Was a super relaxing weekend in Whistler, the spa was 10/10
[2023-05-15, 7:03:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yo what’re you upto tomorrow eve??
[2023-05-15, 7:03:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ryan’s coming into town tonight and wanted to know if you’d be down for some dinner and drinks after work??
[2023-05-15, 7:04:52 PM] Seth Schilbe: I made plans with Meah to do the Grouse Grind 😅💀.

I thought we were doing dinner with Ryan next Tuesday?
[2023-05-15, 7:08:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ehhhh yea that can work as well, tomorrow would work better but let’s do next week instead! Does Monday eve work instead of Tuesday next week?
[2023-05-15, 7:09:25 PM] Seth Schilbe: Ya I should be back from my weekend activities at a decent time on Monday!
[2023-05-15, 7:10:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sweet! What’re you up to this weekend??
[2023-05-15, 7:12:33 PM] Seth Schilbe: Headed to Harrison for the weekend. It's Katie's birthday on Saturday so Meah and I are heading there with her and a bunch of her friends to stay in a big AirBnB 😁
[2023-05-20, 10:35:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: That sounds swweeeeeet hows it going
[2023-05-20, 10:37:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also, can you do lunch on Monday instead?
[2023-05-21, 1:08:32 AM] Seth Schilbe: It's been a blast! Spent all day by the pool and the lake drinking and hanging out. Perfect weekend!

I'll let you know when we are leaving here on Monday! With traffic it's probably going to be like 2+ hours home (I think checkout is 11am).

So realistically by the time I get home, unpacked, and get to you it'll probably be like 3pm at the earliest
[2023-05-21, 12:35:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh dang ok, how’s about a lunch on Tuesday??
[2023-05-22, 9:10:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh wait! Thursday night dinner whaddya say?
[2023-05-22, 1:26:00 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lol I can do Thursday night 😂
[2023-05-22, 10:21:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perffffect let’s do it 🙏
[2023-05-26, 7:45:16 AM] Seth Schilbe: Thanks for the super fun night with you and Ryan! Was a blast 😁

You guys still looking for people to come do the grind? 👀 What time were you thinking about heading out?
[2023-05-26, 8:16:14 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yessssir!! We’re thinking of heading up there at 4:30!
[2023-05-26, 8:16:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea was a solid time dude!
[2023-05-26, 10:26:09 AM] Seth Schilbe: Leaving at 4:30? Be there for around 5 then? If I leave mine after the team meeting I should be able to meet you guys there 😁
[2023-05-26, 11:40:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: Bro just talked to Ryan and he said he’s meeting with his girlfriends brother to sort out some things for his startup and we don’t think we’ll be able to grind today :/
[2023-05-26, 11:50:31 AM] Seth Schilbe: No worries man! I'll catch Ryan next time he's in town or we'll plan to go see him wherever he ends up 😜
[2023-05-27, 2:52:22 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyuuuup so what’re Meah and Chloe saying for tonight?? Are they in? Caroline can be if they come through
[2023-05-27, 2:56:30 PM] Seth Schilbe: I think they are still undecided 😅 Meah was talking this morning as if they were in but they could just as easily bail. They are getting tattoos until 5 and then they should have a decision one way or another.

If Caroline messages and says she's coming if they come then I think that would help solidify things 😂
[2023-05-27, 2:57:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok ok perfect, the thing is, Caroline’s not 100% in and can just as easily bail as well 🥸
[2023-05-27, 2:58:37 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lol these girls 😂. I'm just headed out for a ride on the bike up to squamish. When I get there I'll check in with Meah, Chloe, and Katie and see what they have planned out for the evening and let you know
[2023-05-27, 3:04:21 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok sounds good, keep me posted 🥳😎
[2023-05-27, 3:04:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: You’re a 100% in tho, right?
[2023-05-27, 4:20:56 PM] Seth Schilbe: Unless Meah, Katie and Chloe invite me to something better 😜 (but you can come to whatever that might be 😅😂)
[2023-05-27, 4:34:19 PM] Seth Schilbe: Do you still have the party room booked tonight? What time did you have that booked for?
[2023-05-27, 4:57:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yessssir! 6 pm to 11 pm I think!
[2023-05-27, 4:57:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: So we got it for a while, definitely a good spot to pre
[2023-05-27, 4:59:35 PM] Seth Schilbe: Nice! alright I'm leaving Squamish now, home by 6:30. I'll get ready and head to your place for like 8pm?

Still nothing from the girls. I may or may not bring them with me to yours depending on how they are feeling? 😅
[2023-05-27, 5:08:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds good man, I’m easy, I think Caroline is a no for now 🙃
[2023-05-27, 6:30:05 PM] Seth Schilbe: Meah and Chloe are in, Katie is a no lol

So convince Caroline
[2023-05-27, 6:46:02 PM] Seth Schilbe: Girls want to come home and change before we head to yours 🙃 ETA is 8:30
[2023-05-27, 7:26:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh siiiick!
[2023-05-27, 7:26:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea Caroline is still a no 😛
[2023-05-27, 7:34:39 PM] Seth Schilbe: I'll wait until we are on our way to tell the girls that 🤣🤣
[2023-05-27, 7:47:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perfect, see you soon!
[2023-05-27, 8:27:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m doing a quick alc run, are you folks coming in from Yaletown roundhouse?
[2023-05-27, 8:40:05 PM] Seth Schilbe: We drove in! Going to stop at Tim Hortons then come up. You want anything?
[2023-05-27, 8:40:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m good! Just did my alc run, are y’all BYOB?
[2023-05-27, 8:40:48 PM] Seth Schilbe: Yes!
[2023-05-27, 8:50:41 PM] Seth Schilbe: Out front
[2023-05-27, 8:51:49 PM] Seth Schilbe: What's the code for the stairwell? 🤣
[2023-05-28, 12:55:02 PM] Seth Schilbe: Headed out to Port Moody for the day if you aren't up to anything and want to join! We'll be near Rocky Point Park all day.

How are you feeling after last night? 😅
[2023-05-28, 9:05:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: Fuckkk just spent the day out at Stanley park, forgot that I’d invited myself to this! 😂
[2023-05-28, 9:15:02 PM] Seth Schilbe: Haha no worries! Hope you enjoyed the day out at Stanley Park 😁
[2023-06-07, 6:29:38 PM] Seth Schilbe: Sweet talked her into heating it up for me 😎
[2023-06-07, 6:34:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: Let’s gooooo
[2023-06-07, 6:35:15 PM] Seth Schilbe: Just waiting for you
[2023-06-07, 6:57:53 PM] Seth Schilbe: Where'd you end up?
[2023-06-24, 2:48:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayuuuup dude don’t think we’ll be able to come thru today, just pooped from an early tennis this morning! Tryna wear off the jet lag but would’ve loved to meet your mum and stepdad! Tell ‘em I said hi 👋

How long are they here for?
[2023-06-24, 3:11:42 PM] Seth Schilbe: No worries! Just until tomorrow 😅. Next time!
[2023-06-29, 12:15:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: If you wanna risk being oncall and windsurfing bro we’re going tomorrow at 1:30 pm
[2023-06-29, 12:21:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: It’s only 3 hours, you can be close to shore…
[2023-06-29, 6:40:47 PM] Seth Schilbe: On the left side of the volleyball courts when you guys get here!
[2023-06-29, 6:45:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: We’re on the old spot
[2023-06-29, 10:00:47 PM] Seth Schilbe: ‎Missed voice call
[2023-07-01, 10:21:25 AM] Seth Schilbe: Need us to bring anything this morning?? We'll be there just after 11!
[2023-07-01, 10:41:14 AM] Shardul Bansal: Hiyyya just some breakfasty stuff like some muffins or something? Also, sweeeet, see you soon!!
[2023-07-01, 4:23:52 PM] Seth Schilbe: Decided to just head back to New West for the evening. Meah and I are pretty beat so probably just going to nap and chill. Was hard work losing at Catan 😜

Thanks so much for hosting! That was a ton of fun.

No plans tomorrow or Monday if you are free and want to get together and do something 😁
[2023-07-01, 5:14:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ahhhh damn, fair enough, let’s chill Monday eve if you’re up for it? Just tryna hang out with Caroline before she heads out, I think she’s got plans Monday night 🤷‍♂️
[2023-07-02, 1:18:53 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also was a tonne of fun, thanks for coming thru!!
[2023-07-11, 11:47:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: We’re having lunch in YVR11 17th floor!
[2023-07-11, 11:48:51 AM] Seth Schilbe: Be there shortly, just leaving YVR22
[2023-07-11, 11:59:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: We just wrapped up 🙃
‎[2023-07-11, 7:46:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-11, 10:58:54 PM] Seth Schilbe: Okay I found this one the other day, minimum two days but it would be a hell of a good time to stay here - https://air.tl/mETIgRMV

$200/person for the weekend (maybe could convince Katie/Aren to stay for Saturday to make it a little cheaper)

https://air.tl/USG7arBt - also a nice spot, closer to the wineries, no hot tub ($160/person for the two nights)
[2023-07-11, 11:01:12 PM] Seth Schilbe: Smaller condo in Langley - https://air.tl/jvie1COo

Couch isn't a pullout but there is a cot so we would have to draw straws 😅 but it would only be $70 each for the one night or only $120 for Friday + Saturday
[2023-07-12, 9:43:38 AM] Seth Schilbe: Forgot to send this one - https://air.tl/QOfahQrz

Nicest interior by far - $150 each for the weekend
[2023-07-12, 11:53:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh wow this one is really nice, I talked to Caroline and she’s going to Toronto the weekend after, but the problem is that she’s gotta take a weekend to study for her exam, so I think she’ll only be able to do a night!
[2023-07-12, 11:53:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: This looks sweeeet and 1 night here also looks possible
[2023-07-12, 12:24:49 PM] Seth Schilbe: If we do the condo would you and Caroline be cool with sleeping on the couch/cot for 1 night? 😂

Just don't want to have Daniel/Jill fly out to sleep on a couch 🤣
[2023-07-12, 12:55:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea totally 💯 np
[2023-07-12, 1:09:52 PM] Seth Schilbe: Sweet, okay going to book that condo for just the Saturday!
[2023-07-22, 8:33:00 AM] Seth Schilbe: Cannot remember for the life of me when you said that you would be back from your week of silence. Meah is in Seattle for the weekend for Taylor Swift concert 😅 let me know if you want to get together sometime this weekend! Would love to hear all about your experience
[2023-07-23, 10:44:13 AM] Shardul Bansal: Duuuude shalom shalom just got out, I’ll be back by around 12:30 pm, honestly would be super down to get together in the afternoon if you’re around. Have a lot to share and talk about
[2023-07-23, 12:43:28 PM] Seth Schilbe: No plans for the afternoon! Was supposed to be hiking but I cut it short due to me own stupidity (I'll tell you all about it later).

Let me know when you are settled and I'll make my way to your place!
[2023-07-23, 2:22:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh sweet, honestly, how’s around 6pm and we can grab some dinner?
[2023-07-23, 2:49:01 PM] Seth Schilbe: Sounds good to me!
[2023-07-23, 5:05:44 PM] Seth Schilbe: Going to ride my bike over 🏍️! Can I park in your parkade? Leaving mine in about 15, should be there right at 6
[2023-07-23, 5:15:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perfect, yes, yes you can
[2023-07-23, 5:16:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: Can you give me the license and the make
[2023-07-23, 5:18:46 PM] Seth Schilbe: J30825, Honda CBR500

[2023-08-18, 1:31:08 PM] Seth Schilbe: Windsurfing on Tuesday?
[2023-08-18, 2:07:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yoyooooo how’s it going???
[2023-08-18, 2:07:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: how’s the vacay?
[2023-08-18, 2:07:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m sending you messages on slack to keep you up to date when you’re back 😛
[2023-08-18, 2:16:13 PM] Seth Schilbe: Things are good! Spent the day getting absolutely drenched cycling around a little island on the west coast of Ireland. Will have to tell you all about the trip when I get back 😁
[2023-08-18, 2:16:55 PM] Seth Schilbe: Oh lord, definitely not going to check Slack until Monday morning then 🤣
[2023-08-18, 2:17:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: Noice I’m excited!
[2023-08-18, 2:18:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: I mean, I haven’t really been sending you much this week, just that Aman, Florian, Ash and Anatoly are out so the CP operator just decided to modify a dynamo table in pdx without 2PR
[2023-08-18, 2:18:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: The control plane is retarded
[2023-08-18, 2:18:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m headed to Sam Smith with Caroline!
[2023-08-18, 2:19:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: Could be down Monday 🤓
[2023-08-18, 2:19:21 PM] Shardul Bansal: But also I’ve got a tennis tourney in Coquitlam so might have to play it by ear
[2023-08-18, 2:20:02 PM] Seth Schilbe: I'm sorry they did what 🙃🙃

Also how on earth did someone not say no to all of us going on vacation at the same time?? That's literally all the senior people on the CP OOTO 😅
[2023-08-18, 2:20:31 PM] Seth Schilbe: I'll probably be wrecked on Monday, don't land until 7pm on Sunday. Let's plan for the week after then
[2023-08-18, 2:20:41 PM] Seth Schilbe: You still in for Meahs Bday on Saturday next weekend?
[2023-08-18, 2:22:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds good, that might be ideal
[2023-08-18, 2:22:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea you’ll hear all about it on Monday morning
[2023-08-18, 2:24:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: Tony, Jay, Chi and Curtis didn’t even bat an eye when this operator told the team during standup that they’ve modified customer data in production without 2PR by manually editing items using the dynamodb console 🤯
[2023-08-18, 2:26:22 PM] Seth Schilbe: Cannot wait, might just extend my vacation by a week 🤣
[2023-08-18, 2:28:01 PM] Seth Schilbe: 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

Does everyone know about this? Has the issue been corrected? Do they know they can't just manually update records because it will corrupt them and cause a poison pill that will end up in the DLQ? 🙃
[2023-08-18, 4:15:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, the change has been rolled back, it was also a sev3 so we’ll see if it’s brought up or not
[2023-08-23, 12:18:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: Lunch a clock?
[2023-08-23, 12:37:14 PM] Seth Schilbe: Just heading down now, see you in the lunchroom in a few
[2023-08-25, 11:29:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll be at yours by 9:30 tomorrow morning G!
[2023-08-25, 11:30:34 PM] Seth Schilbe: See you tomorrow! How did the tournament games go? You playing in Coquitlam Sunday morning?
[2023-08-25, 11:31:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: No sir, got back a while ago, just resting on Sunday for me
[2023-08-26, 9:15:10 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll be at yours by 5 to 10!
[2023-08-26, 9:18:01 AM] Seth Schilbe: Sounds good! Going to grab some breakfast for the road from Tim's for Meah and I. You want anything?
[2023-08-26, 9:25:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m good, already had breakfast
[2023-08-26, 10:06:03 AM] Seth Schilbe: Didn't factor waiting for the elevator
[2023-08-26, 8:17:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Did you take a shit in this toilet I can barely breathe ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-08-26, 8:17:39 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lol no 🤣

[2023-08-28, 3:27:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyuuuup what’re you upto this weekend? Got plans Friday night? Wanna do something?
[2023-08-28, 4:57:13 PM] Seth Schilbe: No plans Friday! I'm oncall all weekend but I'm down to do something. Anything you had in mind?
[2023-08-28, 6:08:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: Getting sauceddddd or high 👀🌚
[2023-08-28, 6:08:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: Either or
[2023-08-28, 6:08:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oooh, could actually be down to go karting if you’re interested?
[2023-08-28, 6:16:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: Not sure if any of those are oncall friendly 😣😭
[2023-08-28, 6:17:32 PM] Seth Schilbe: Haha karting and then some drinks or a smoke sounds good to me! Want to see if some of the other guys want to join?

If there are enough of us I'm sure we can all figure out any Sev2s 🤣🤣
[2023-08-28, 6:21:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perfect
[2023-08-28, 6:22:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll reach out to Jin/Tony/Cathal
[2023-08-28, 6:22:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: Anyone else you got in mind?
[2023-08-28, 6:47:56 PM] Seth Schilbe: Nope that sounds good to me!
[2023-08-28, 10:30:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: Dude wanna go see Barbie tomorrow eve with Tony and I? We got tickets out at Park Royal, thinking of dressing up 🌚👀
[2023-08-29, 7:11:26 AM] Seth Schilbe: Haha I'll pass, don't want to push my oncall luck too much this week 😝

Are you dressing up as Barbie or as Ken? 🤣

I'll see you in the office today though!
[2023-08-29, 7:12:10 AM] Shardul Bansal: I think as Ken, it’s too late to try to dress up as Barbie 🫨
[2023-08-29, 7:12:23 AM] Shardul Bansal: Noice, I’ll be there!
[2023-08-29, 7:15:25 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ooooh, I forgot but YVR22 is doing a breakfast that I might have to try and hit that up, wanna meet there and we can waltz into YVR11 for lunch? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-09-02, 1:53:59 AM] Seth Schilbe: Thanks for the stellar night dude, that was a blast. Let me know about Monday!

Love you ❤️
[2023-09-02, 8:00:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: Dude that was a blast and I’m in absolutely no state to go to tennis today FUCK
[2023-09-02, 8:00:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: we were gonna do a cheeky lil tennis tourney but imma be in bed
[2023-09-02, 1:49:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: I nursed a hangover this morning fuck meeeeeeee
[2023-09-02, 2:18:29 PM] Seth Schilbe: Lolll sorry you weren't in good enough shape to go play tennis this morning 😂

Hope you are feeling a little better now? 🤣
[2023-09-03, 11:16:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ahahaha I did end up feeling better but Saturday was a full write off
[2023-09-03, 11:17:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also FYI Im still very much down to kart tomorrow, I’ll give speeders/TBC a call in the morning about availability and I’ll try to head to yours for around noon?
[2023-09-03, 11:17:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: Will keep you posted on timing 💅🏿
[2023-09-03, 11:33:50 PM] Seth Schilbe: Ya sounds like a plan! Just keep me posted in the morning 😁
[2023-09-04, 11:08:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: Speeders is not available today, imma try TBC
[2023-09-04, 11:10:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: TBC isn’t answering…they both do have drop-ins
[2023-09-04, 11:11:22 AM] Shardul Bansal: They’re 5 min apart from each other, I say we try speeders first, they might have some drop in availability and then we can try TBC?
[2023-09-04, 11:12:22 AM] Seth Schilbe: Yep works for me!
[2023-09-04, 11:33:09 AM] Shardul Bansal: Booked 5 races for the 2 of us at Speeders, we gotta get there at 12:45, imma haul ass to yours
[2023-09-04, 11:40:48 AM] Seth Schilbe: Sweet! Do you want me to just come pick you up at the Metrotown station? Should be 10-15 minutes closer for you

[2023-09-05, 6:17:34 PM] Seth Schilbe: Might just work from home tomorrow. How do you feel about taking the seabus to north Van and I would just pick you up at Lonsdale? Then we don't have to contend with Lions Gate 😂
[2023-09-05, 6:17:49 PM] Seth Schilbe: Also cool if Meah comes? She's a 50/50 for wanting to go right now 😅
[2023-09-05, 6:47:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: That would be perfect, super down for this
[2023-09-05, 6:48:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: Totally!! That’d be sick 👍👍👍
[2023-09-06, 1:32:37 PM] Seth Schilbe: I'll meet you at the seabus in North Van around 5:15 if that works for you? Still not sure if Meah is coming or not 😅
[2023-09-06, 2:18:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: I think that’s totally doable let’s gedit
[2023-09-06, 2:19:21 PM] Shardul Bansal: Maybe I’ll be closer to 5:25, will try for earlier tho

You guys will definitely be faster than us.

[2024-07-12, 5:25:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: yo dude when u filed your taxes with wealthsimple tax, did you claim the portion of rent that's dedicated to your office as a taxable benefit?
[2024-07-12, 6:36:04 PM] Seth Schilbe: Was great to see you too buddy ❤️

Hope your travels to France to see your folks are good! Can't wait to hear all about your trip to Malaysia 😁

[2024-07-12, 6:56:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: cool, im just filling out the T2200 form, just wanted to know if it was ok to do that because technically we’re not mandated to work from home
[2024-07-12, 6:56:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: Mykhailo will have to sign off on mine
[2024-07-12, 7:22:58 PM] Seth Schilbe: Oh ya ya you are all good. Is that why you had to contact HR? I'll email you my version if you want to see how to answer all the question!

Also aren't you like several months late filing your taxes? 🤣
[2024-07-13, 4:13:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ve already filed them, got audited by the CRA for doing a backclaim for last year 😔
[2024-07-13, 4:38:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: Did you fill out the T2200?
[2024-07-13, 7:51:27 AM] Seth Schilbe: Ahh shit that sucks!

[2024-10-11, 1:26:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha that’ll be at least a year longer from now
[2024-10-11, 1:27:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: also more like — you’ll have more runway when we decide to co-found something together 👀
[2024-10-11, 1:28:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: let’s ideate a bunch when we’re together in Jan, I also suspect that you won’t want to stick around at Cloud Map a whole lot longer
[2024-10-11, 1:28:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: got some interesting tools in my belt for some good co-founder ideation

[2025-01-17, 3:04:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: got the u-haul truck for 1 pm tomorrow, i’m gonna reach mine at around 1:45/2PM, if you aim for around 2:15/2:30 that’ll be ideal. Got the elevator booked from 2 - 4 pm but we likely will only need it for an hour and a bit from 2:30 - 4
[2025-01-17, 3:06:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: Emptying the unit would be ideal, but in case that doesn’t happen, the big items (dining table/bed/sofa/desk) are the focus, i can make trips for smaller stuff after since i’ll be handing the keys the week after on sunday 🙂
[2025-01-17, 3:07:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: after returning the truck we drink
[2025-01-17, 3:07:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: dinner + drinks + stripper on me

We are young attractive guys, I'm sure we can go out and find some fun that doesn't involve you paying someone for it 🤣

I'll be at yours for 2:30!
[2025-01-18, 1:54:43 PM] Seth Schilbe: On my way, have to drop a TV off at Tony's first so I'll be at yours around 2:35-2:40!
[2025-01-18, 1:55:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: Perfect, going to grab the truck right now

[2023-03-21, 12:33:47 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Also, we’re all good for QE tomorrow morning at the crack of dawn?
[2023-03-21, 12:35:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Assuming weather is good that works for me
[2023-03-21, 12:35:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Go freeze our asses off
[2023-03-21, 12:41:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sweet let’s do it 👍
[2023-03-21, 8:30:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was planning on being there at 7am btw
[2023-03-21, 9:11:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sunrise is at 7:11 so that’s prolly the earliest we can start anyway ahaha
[2023-03-21, 9:12:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: hahaha okay, see you both a little after 7 theb
[2023-03-22, 6:46:10 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Be there in 25ish
[2023-03-22, 11:04:19 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: How late did you two play?
[2023-03-22, 11:09:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Just an additional 10 point baseline game
[2023-03-22, 11:09:36 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Where Shardul gave me a proper beating
[2023-03-22, 11:10:56 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: You deserved it after the serving
[2023-03-22, 11:11:29 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Fair enough
[2023-03-22, 11:12:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The S&V was so good today. You should keep that up.
[2023-03-22, 11:13:21 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Thank you! Will keep Working on that.
[2023-03-22, 11:13:32 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Dude, you were a force from the baseline today
[2023-03-22, 11:13:41 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I couldn’t get any leverage
[2023-03-22, 11:14:00 AM] Avi Mehrotra: The best I could do was hit neutral balls back.
[2023-03-22, 11:14:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: This is a lie, the score was 11-9 ahahaha
[2023-03-22, 11:14:47 AM] Avi Mehrotra: That’s because you made dumb errors here and there. But you had full control from the get go
[2023-03-22, 11:14:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea we wrapped up around 9:45, didn’t play too long
[2023-03-22, 11:15:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: but…it’s quarter past 11 and I’ve done 20 min of work…
[2023-03-22, 11:28:46 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Lol I haven’t even started
[2023-03-22, 11:35:20 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Your shots were coming a little slower thanks to not being indoors. Let me take a good cut at it every time.
[2023-03-22, 11:35:44 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Frustrated at my serve but my baseline game feels pretty monsterous.
[2023-03-22, 11:36:07 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oof 😂
[2023-03-22, 11:41:04 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Good choice of word to describe your forehands today.
[2023-03-22, 11:44:25 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thanks 😁. 

I think I might go hit some serves tonight 😂
[2023-03-22, 11:46:58 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ahahahah Adrian honestly if you’re not too tired on Sunday, come thru even just to practice your serves for a few hours…
[2023-03-22, 11:48:15 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think I probably will. Stanley park?
[2023-03-22, 11:49:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yessssir
[2023-03-22, 11:50:51 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think Alexi has a family lunch/brunch at 11 or 12. I could head over after she goes to that.
[2023-03-22, 12:07:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok sweet honestly 12 pm would be great 👍
[2023-03-22, 12:10:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds good 👍
[2023-03-25, 9:22:10 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm good for tomorrow btw. Assuming weather cooperates
[2023-03-25, 11:53:40 AM] Avi Mehrotra: YES
[2023-03-25, 11:54:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, down to hit at UBC or Richmond if the weather doesn’t cooperate, I can book later today if it looks like it’ll continue raining
[2023-03-25, 11:54:42 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Good call
[2023-03-25, 12:06:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds good to me 👍
[2023-03-25, 12:08:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: @16472039624 I’m down to start a little earlier while we wait for Adrian tomorrow at Stanley
[2023-03-25, 12:08:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Finish off that decider set
[2023-03-25, 1:40:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds good, do you want to meet at 12 pm or earlier still?
[2023-03-25, 1:42:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: My schedule is being shuffled around a bunch. I think I can still play though. 

On a side note, If you two came to Ladner we would have brand new empty courts for free for as long as we would want 🥸
[2023-03-25, 1:43:15 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think I'd also have access to a squeegee if the courts are a little damp
[2023-03-25, 7:29:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 11 should be nice. Gotta pick up my racquet from the stringer before
[2023-03-25, 7:30:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m confused now. Everything sounds like a good ideas.
[2023-03-25, 7:32:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can play for longer if you all come here. Otherwise I'll try to be there at 12:15ish.
[2023-03-25, 7:32:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If you're are Stanley
[2023-03-25, 7:34:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ladner Tennis Club
https://maps.app.goo.gl/pM7XMfRQGoCCnxjJA

Otherwise if you come here 100% we have a court for the whole day
[2023-03-25, 7:34:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: I think Santiago my friend is joining (Avi you met him last week), Stanley would be easier this time but down for Ladner next time!
[2023-03-25, 7:34:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds good 👍
[2023-03-25, 7:35:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: We can easily grab 2 courts at Stanley Park tomorrow but I think as the weather gets better, Ladner would make more sense!
[2023-03-25, 7:36:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Im just expecting Stanley to be like every court in Van and be like 30 mins on 30 mins ofd
[2023-03-25, 7:36:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Off*. But maybe in wronf
[2023-03-25, 9:07:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Too cold for that kind of traffic imo
[2023-03-25, 9:07:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Now at least
[2023-03-25, 9:08:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hope so!
[2023-03-26, 10:06:52 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Meet at noon ish
[2023-03-26, 10:07:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: 👍
[2023-03-26, 10:07:04 AM] Avi Mehrotra: R&R opens at 11 today
[2023-03-26, 10:07:08 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Gotta go there first
[2023-03-26, 10:07:17 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Need anything, anyone?
[2023-03-26, 10:07:43 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Im good thanks!
[2023-03-26, 10:07:57 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I picked up a couple of cans of Dunlops
[2023-03-26, 10:08:02 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Last time
[2023-03-26, 10:08:17 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Want to try another ball or are we sticking with old reliable
[2023-03-26, 10:08:54 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I like the Wilson US Opens a lot too. I'd also be down to try like Babolat. I am just anti-Penn 😂
[2023-03-26, 10:09:19 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Understood
[2023-03-26, 10:27:30 AM] Shardul Bansal: I have a tonne of those Wilson US Open balls!
[2023-03-26, 10:28:07 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Okay sweet!
[2023-03-26, 10:53:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: My partner's plans got cancelled so she will be hanging out with us while we play today.
[2023-03-26, 11:09:39 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Lol mine is coming too.
[2023-03-26, 11:09:53 AM] Avi Mehrotra: At least they won’t get bored watching us play
[2023-03-26, 11:10:16 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmao wow, a girlfriend playdate
[2023-03-26, 11:10:33 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Don’t say that out loud lmao
[2023-03-26, 11:13:21 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh yeah I'ma get smacked
[2023-03-26, 11:34:28 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Be there in ~50
[2023-03-26, 11:37:18 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Same.
[2023-03-26, 11:37:24 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Sorry @16472039624
[2023-03-26, 11:37:35 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Avi standard time runs a little behind
[2023-03-26, 11:37:41 AM] Avi Mehrotra: But you know that already
[2023-03-26, 11:38:02 AM] Shardul Bansal: No problemoooo ahahahaha
[2023-03-26, 12:20:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Court 17
[2023-03-26, 12:26:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: 17? I’m at 6, and I’ve got 3 empty courts here…
[2023-03-26, 12:26:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: But it’s looking empty overall I’m coming to you
[2023-03-26, 12:27:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Come here, corner courts get stollen less
[2023-03-27, 2:05:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://youtu.be/pulUgsfvE5E
[2023-03-27, 2:05:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: oh damn
[2023-03-27, 2:07:22 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly the Stanley Park courts are gonna be fantastic for recording, the fence is so close we can stick the phone way higher with Avi’s tripod
[2023-03-27, 2:16:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is pretty sick
[2023-03-27, 2:16:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: thanks for uploading
[2023-03-27, 2:16:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also: We all footfault like crazy
[2023-03-27, 2:40:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yessss, my tennis also looks way prettier in my head than it does in reality
[2023-03-27, 2:40:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Always does 😂
[2023-03-27, 2:41:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm happy with my tennis until we mix serves in and then I implode
[2023-03-27, 8:31:01 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Just saw this. Beautiful stuff.
[2023-03-27, 8:31:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ll pack it in my bag as a permanent thing.
[2023-03-31, 5:43:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Tuesday morning at QE?
[2023-03-31, 7:54:46 PM] Santiago: ‎Avi Mehrotra added Santiago
[2023-03-31, 7:53:51 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 👍
[2023-03-31, 7:54:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Too much hype after Sinner + Alcaraz
[2023-03-31, 7:54:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Haha
[2023-03-31, 7:55:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Added Santiago too. He said he’d be down to play on weekday mornings
[2023-03-31, 7:56:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sweet. We can take over all the courts and lie to people about it being an event like the old people do.
[2023-03-31, 7:56:47 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Hahahaga
[2023-03-31, 8:03:24 PM] Santiago: Hello hello - yeah next week early AM should work. Stanley park booking system should be up and running, so we could also have that as an option for a PM hit.
[2023-03-31, 8:04:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I've been enjoying the mornings. But I'd also be keen for this. Better than playing the waiting game
[2023-03-31, 8:53:31 PM] Santiago: You guys wait in the Am?
[2023-03-31, 8:54:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It was just us the whole time from 7-9:30 last time
[2023-03-31, 8:55:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just me and Avi spent all last summer struggling to find a court after work
[2023-03-31, 9:03:23 PM] Santiago: Ahh fair fair. I’m fine to aim for an early AM next week
[2023-03-31, 9:44:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yassss. Should be good!
[2023-03-31, 9:57:02 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Adrian how’s the new place?
[2023-03-31, 10:51:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Moving in tomorrow/Sunday. So just been whirlwind packing today.
[2023-03-31, 10:52:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yoooooo Santiagoooooooo I’m down for Tuesday let’s do it! Not around this weekend but also down for PM hit sometime soon
[2023-04-01, 4:23:05 PM] Santiago: @16047827064 @17788869646, you guys down for Tuesday AM? What time you guys meet up at?
[2023-04-01, 5:01:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-04-01, 5:01:22 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Around 7ish
[2023-04-01, 5:01:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Also, we can play at Granville loop park
[2023-04-01, 5:01:59 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It’s always empty
[2023-04-01, 5:11:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 7am. How's the parking by the Granville loop?
[2023-04-01, 5:17:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You can park in my buildings basement
[2023-04-01, 5:39:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll just call you when I'm close by theb
[2023-04-01, 5:49:33 PM] Santiago: How are the courts? I sometimes find that neighborhood courts are meh
[2023-04-01, 6:10:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The surface is pretty good. Ones a little tilted if I recall.
[2023-04-02, 10:59:48 AM] Santiago: Where is the park?
‎[2023-04-02, 11:08:18 AM] Santiago: ‎image omitted
[2023-04-02, 12:56:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-04-02, 1:20:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Think the courts will be dry by Tuesday morning?
[2023-04-02, 2:16:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: QE will be if we do that. A bit more exposed to the wind etc.
[2023-04-02, 2:16:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think they both will be though
[2023-04-03, 2:07:48 PM] Santiago: https://hackaday.com/2023/04/03/tennis-balls-serve-as-decent-bicycle-tires-that-dont-easily-puncture/
[2023-04-03, 2:07:58 PM] Santiago: Y’all showing up on this tomorrow?
[2023-04-03, 2:12:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yup, just gotta crack 15 tins to get my tires set.
[2023-04-03, 2:23:49 PM] Santiago: That’s like 2 hrs worth of Wilson balls
[2023-04-03, 2:34:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: I wonder if they lose their pressure after some use as well 🧐
[2023-04-03, 4:21:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Hahahaha
[2023-04-03, 6:51:57 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So I have to demo a portable eye tracker on court. I’ll bring it tomorrow. Should be fun.
[2023-04-03, 7:17:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh baby, we gonna be YouTubers
[2023-04-03, 8:01:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm excited to get more footage. Going to try a different motion on my serve. Definitely unhappy with my take back after watching the other footage 😛
[2023-04-03, 8:10:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yes, but eyetracking for SCIENCE
[2023-04-03, 8:10:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And potentially my MA thesis
[2023-04-03, 8:14:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 😶 that would be sweeet
[2023-04-03, 8:15:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmk if you need any help with like applying for grants etc in the fall btw
[2023-04-03, 8:20:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yesssir
[2023-04-03, 8:20:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I will 100% take you up on that
[2023-04-03, 8:21:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Y’all want espresso before playing lol
[2023-04-03, 8:22:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll probably just coffee and meet you all there. I have come to the realization I can just bus the Granville lmao
[2023-04-03, 8:22:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’d be more than happy to make some and bring them over
[2023-04-03, 8:31:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also 7am?
[2023-04-03, 8:35:58 PM] Santiago: I’m down to meet up a bit earlier(645?). Gotta be at work earlyish
[2023-04-03, 8:36:12 PM] Santiago: I’ll take espresso ❤️
[2023-04-03, 9:05:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: 6:45 works better for me too! Santiago we can start a lil earlier 🫡
[2023-04-03, 10:57:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 645 works for moi as well
[2023-04-04, 6:45:56 AM] Shardul Bansal: 5 min out still
[2023-04-04, 6:46:22 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just on the 99. Be there in a few as well
[2023-04-04, 6:48:58 AM] Santiago: Here now
[2023-04-04, 6:50:45 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Coming with coffee
[2023-04-10, 10:53:21 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Wednesday weather looks good. Anyone keen to play early?
[2023-04-10, 12:07:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yessssir, also down for tomorrow tbh
[2023-04-10, 12:55:40 PM] Santiago: Can I extend the invitation out the Deep?
[2023-04-10, 12:55:57 PM] Santiago: I should be able(weather permitting)
[2023-04-10, 1:02:35 PM] Santiago: To*
‎[2023-04-10, 1:05:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎GIF omitted
‎[2023-04-10, 1:08:40 PM] Santiago: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-04-10, 1:09:19 PM] Santiago: @16047827064 and @16472039624 know Deep
[2023-04-10, 5:35:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: I love Deeptanshu and if I didn’t care so much about my tennis, I would say absolutely.

The problem is, and this is difficult to say without coming off as an asshole, is that he would be the weakest of the 4 of us. I’m already not playing as much tennis as I normally would like, and I really like the level at which we play. I’m already in a bunch of WhatsApp tennis groups and I don’t love the idea of including a bunch of people that I’m not excited to play with. 

Now, if someone on the group feels differently and the more the merrier, I wouldn’t mind adding him to the group. But, I’m opposed right now.
[2023-04-10, 5:36:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: Now, this is nothing against Deep, he’s a great fella and I’m gonna go grab a bite with him to eat. If you’re in touch with him @16138999983 , you can let me be the asshole and I’ll let him know tonight.
[2023-04-10, 5:49:34 PM] Santiago: It’s all good! I totally understand. I just keep postponing his invitations to play, so was trying to make it up to him. I’ll just play with him another time
[2023-04-10, 5:49:37 PM] Santiago: 👍🏽
[2023-04-10, 5:50:27 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: We can always invite him sometime to come hit but not add him to the group. It is nice having a more dedicated high level crew
[2023-04-10, 5:51:37 PM] Santiago: 👍🏽
[2023-04-10, 5:56:19 PM] Santiago: Love the honesty. Was asking more out of guilt tbh
[2023-04-10, 5:58:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: Fair enough man, I’ve just told him I’m not really able to play with him anymore because I also started saying no a lot but I have said I’m very much down to go grab dinner with him!
[2023-04-10, 5:58:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also, if any of y’all want to, feel free to join for dinner tonight!
[2023-04-11, 7:28:06 AM] Santiago: Y’all think it will be dry tomorrow AM? Down to play Thursday AM
[2023-04-11, 7:37:03 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think it'll be fine tomorrow. I can do Thursday instead if that's preferable
[2023-04-11, 7:37:31 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hourly forecast shows the rain stopping late this afternoon
[2023-04-11, 9:03:31 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Now this is the right way to do this. Props
[2023-04-11, 9:04:11 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Tomorrow should be good.
[2023-04-11, 4:50:56 PM] Santiago: So we meeting up tomorrow? <645?

[2023-04-12, 1:26:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds really sick tho

[2023-04-14, 5:30:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Fernandez looked shockingly good tbh. Hit like no errors and a ton of winners. I'd be surprised if she didn't get back to the top 20
[2023-04-14, 5:32:53 PM] Santiago: Is it only two matches being played today?
[2023-04-14, 6:23:53 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah just the two. 2nd match is going to be a long one I think.

[2023-05-04, 4:25:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: Late afternoon/evening actually works much better for me on Saturday Santiago, can we aim for that?
[2023-05-04, 5:01:29 PM] Santiago: Should we aim for AM and have PM as plan B?
[2023-05-04, 5:30:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea let’s do it

[2023-05-07, 3:51:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thanks! I'm pretty happy about it. I paced it almost perfect. I feel completely thrashed now. Turns out 42.2k is very far.

[2023-05-11, 11:44:04 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll let you know about Sunday morning! Not sure if I'm free yet
[2023-05-12, 10:20:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: Alrighty boys I wanna pull the trigger on this: https://www.amazon.ca/DUNLOP-Australian-Extra-All-Court-Tennis/dp/B082LX9RPM/ref=sr_1_2?crid=ILUSJZD1Y6SF&keywords=dunlop%2BAO%2Btennis%2Bballs&qid=1683954925&sprefix=dunlop%2Bao%2Btennis%2Bballs%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-2&th=1&psc=1
[2023-05-12, 10:21:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: 24 cans, 3 balls per can, total 180 bucks, comes out to 7.5 bucks per can
[2023-05-12, 10:21:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: Are we in?
[2023-05-12, 10:24:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You can get them for less at R&R I think?
[2023-05-12, 10:25:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Like individual cans are 6.80 I think?
[2023-05-12, 10:27:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh yup I checked and you’re right
[2023-05-12, 11:07:19 PM] Santiago: I get a discount at R&R 👀

[2023-05-12, 11:34:35 PM] Avi Mehrotra: We are in, but agree with Adrian.
[2023-05-12, 11:34:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Also
[2023-05-12, 11:34:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tads is probably even cheaper
[2023-05-12, 11:35:45 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm keen if we can find the tins for less than per single can.
[2023-05-13, 7:03:52 AM] Santiago: I can ask the guys at R&R next time I’m in and call Tads tufts
[2023-05-13, 7:03:54 AM] Santiago: Today
[2023-05-13, 7:05:47 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ok yea that’d be sweet, maybe we can get a mix of cans, I’m indifferent
[2023-05-13, 9:35:32 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is probably the best plan  if you're playing tournaments. Pretty easy to get used to a ball
[2023-05-13, 11:56:40 AM] Santiago: Y’all down for a Tuesday hit?
[2023-05-13, 11:56:58 AM] Santiago: Also, feel free to join Abbey and I tomorrow at SP 7am

[2023-05-16, 8:59:15 AM] Santiago: @17788869646, we are planning on getting together this coming Monday for a hangout. Join us! I’m curious to hear about your work… shame I have never asked you. I think there is a ton of overlap with my work
[2023-05-16, 9:00:16 AM] Santiago: That said, let’s lock something down. Monday is a holiday, so we can do either lunch or dinner. I’m fine to host or we can go somewhere. What would work best?
[2023-05-16, 9:00:47 AM] Santiago: Also, we are thinking of meeting up again for a hit this Thursday.
[2023-05-16, 9:01:40 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I should be free Monday evening!
[2023-05-16, 9:04:17 AM] Santiago: Yesssir
[2023-05-16, 10:23:32 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Dinner works better. I might have a meeting with my PI on Monday afternoon
[2023-05-16, 9:42:24 PM] Santiago: Considering that shardul will miss this Thursdays hit, I extended the invite to abbey. @17788869646 and @16047827064, you guys down?
[2023-05-16, 9:42:34 PM] Santiago: He is pretty good
[2023-05-16, 10:03:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I might take a day so that I stop ripping my hand open but I'll confirm tomorrow night
[2023-05-16, 10:26:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Suuuuper down for Monday night dinner next week!
[2023-05-17, 1:47:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Down!
[2023-05-17, 7:22:51 PM] Santiago: RE Monday: let’s lock it down for 5-6PM. I’m fine to host if its 6ish ppl total unless ppl prefer a restaurant. Bring a snack and/or beverage🫡🫡🫡
[2023-05-17, 7:22:59 PM] Santiago: See y’all tomorrow AM
[2023-05-17, 7:23:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: My hands still messed for tomorrow. Should be good for Monday 👍.
[2023-05-17, 7:24:48 PM] Santiago: And possibly swimming trunks for hot tub 🛀
[2023-05-17, 7:50:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ryan and I are locked in!
[2023-05-17, 11:37:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tennis in the AM?
[2023-05-18, 6:00:56 AM] Santiago: Yes sir
[2023-05-18, 6:41:26 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Omw
[2023-05-18, 11:36:19 AM] Santiago: Game plan for Monday: @16472039624 and Ryan, can you bring some beverages(beer, ciders and non alcoholic?). @17788869646,  can you bring a fruit or veg tray or appetizer? @16047827064 and I will take care of the veg dinner 💪🏽
[2023-05-18, 11:37:40 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can bring a fruit tray. I also have silly/complex allergies so I might just bring some sushi or whatever for myself if that's okay with you all?
[2023-05-18, 11:38:21 AM] Santiago: All good sir! Let me know if we need to be extra cautious with anything
[2023-05-18, 11:39:09 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Nah, just weird intolerances. X-contamination is usually fine.
[2023-05-19, 9:10:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds like a plan! Lemme know if y’all need a hand with a veg dinner, we can also help with that!
[2023-05-20, 1:27:16 PM] Santiago: @16047827064, can you bring a mix of veg for the Thai curry? I got the other ingredients
[2023-05-20, 1:29:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Any chance you guys could make a list of ingredients for what you're cooking for the curry? I might be fine to have it actually.
[2023-05-20, 1:29:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Would be happy to pitch in/help then
[2023-05-20, 1:32:25 PM] Santiago: Coconut milk, veg stock, tofu, basic curry paste, rice and whatever veggies @16047827064 grabs. I’m pretty flexible
[2023-05-20, 1:34:25 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Would you guys be down to do like a chickpea/lentil curry instead of Tofu?
[2023-05-20, 1:35:10 PM] Santiago: I think we can swing that! Any veg intolerances?
[2023-05-20, 1:35:44 PM] Santiago: I’ll soak some chickpeas overnight 🫡🫡🫡
[2023-05-20, 1:36:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Like just soy (mostly soybean oil). Can't do gluten or dairy.
[2023-05-20, 1:36:39 PM] Santiago: Ahhh ok! So go nuts on the veg @16047827064
[2023-05-20, 1:38:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thanks! Sorry for the allergies. My body decided to destroy itself like 5 years ago and I started reacting weirdly to a ton of foods
[2023-05-20, 9:12:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Should we do something Indian?
[2023-05-20, 9:13:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Lot easier, more homey and faster.
[2023-05-20, 9:14:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That sounds good. I figured that's what we were doing?
[2023-05-20, 9:17:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Just confirming
[2023-05-20, 9:18:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: We also planning on hitting a ball beforehand?
[2023-05-20, 9:34:09 PM] Santiago: Sure, but you gotta lock down a dish. Something easy that we know will work. Otherwise, I say we do the Thai curry
[2023-05-20, 9:38:27 PM] Santiago: I’m easy. If ppl are down, we can try to get a court?
[2023-05-20, 9:39:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'd be keen. Tennis then chill sounds like a sweet day
[2023-05-20, 10:35:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’d be down for a hit before! Should we try booking out at Stanley Park?
[2023-05-20, 10:35:37 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm keen but idk how
[2023-05-20, 10:36:45 PM] Santiago: Can you book @16472039624? Else I can look into it tomorrow
[2023-05-20, 10:38:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Looking rn!
[2023-05-20, 10:39:36 PM] Santiago: Btw - $145 for a case of dunlop AO(stock permitting at R&R) and 135 for propenn. Save about a dollar per can + maybe 10% off
[2023-05-20, 10:40:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: 14:30-16:30 works? Booking rn
[2023-05-20, 10:41:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds good, I’m good with either! Would prefer ProPenn since they use it in the tournies
[2023-05-20, 10:42:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: Booked!
[2023-05-20, 10:52:37 PM] Santiago: Are you meeting with your PI on Monday @16047827064?
[2023-05-20, 10:53:27 PM] Santiago: Might extend the invite out to Abbey(who plans on joining us for dinner) or ask him to book another court
[2023-05-20, 10:53:37 PM] Santiago: *second court
[2023-05-20, 11:41:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Good either way.

[2023-05-21, 7:52:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sorry I missed that message
[2023-05-21, 9:08:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: My legs are pudding now. I might not make it to tennis lol
[2023-05-21, 9:08:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No sir. He pushed it to Wednesday
[2023-05-21, 9:10:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: All good. You could always just come hit a few balls then hang out too.
[2023-05-21, 9:11:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What compelled you to cycle 50km lmao
[2023-05-21, 9:13:02 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I thought I was agreeing to a 25k ride.
[2023-05-21, 9:13:11 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Turns out it was 25k each way.
[2023-05-21, 9:13:16 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Up a fucking hill.
[2023-05-21, 9:13:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: After playing 2 hours of tennis this morning
[2023-05-21, 9:18:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like a good day! 😂
[2023-05-21, 9:18:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah North Van is just all hills.
[2023-05-21, 9:23:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So many cramps
[2023-05-21, 9:24:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: How do u get rid of them btw
[2023-05-21, 9:24:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Salt
[2023-05-21, 9:24:37 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just add a ton of salt to all your food
[2023-05-21, 9:24:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Have some carbs. Sleep
[2023-05-21, 9:25:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: But the cramps are fitness + electrolytes.
[2023-05-21, 9:25:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And I thought I was getting fitter.
[2023-05-21, 9:26:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Kidding.
[2023-05-21, 9:26:15 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You just rode 50k after playing 2 hours of tennis my guy 😂
[2023-05-21, 9:27:02 PM] Avi Mehrotra: That’s Adrian levels of exercise.
[2023-05-21, 9:27:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Will refrain from doing that again for a while.
[2023-05-21, 9:28:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You're going to buy a road bike, dress up in Lycra and sign and for the Gran Fondo next year next year. Calling it now
[2023-05-21, 9:29:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Road bike yes. Lycra no.
[2023-05-21, 9:29:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: How else will you become Aero
[2023-05-21, 9:31:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah okay.
[2023-05-21, 9:31:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Why do those skin tight jumpsuits have to be so ugly…
[2023-05-21, 9:32:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I grew up in a house where we watched pro Cycling so I think I have a wildly different view of this 😂
[2023-05-21, 9:47:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 😂
[2023-05-22, 9:11:56 AM] Santiago: You coming out tennis @16047827064?
[2023-05-22, 10:13:57 AM] Avi Mehrotra: 2 hours at the shiny new Stanley courts? Tempting.

[2023-05-22, 10:50:08 AM] Santiago: I think that’s called pickelball
[2023-05-22, 10:50:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oooooooooooooo burnnb

[2023-05-22, 10:51:25 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I thought we were friends man…
[2023-05-22, 10:51:33 AM] Santiago: No joke, pickle ball is actually pretty lit
[2023-05-22, 10:51:43 AM] Santiago: Good drinking tennis
[2023-05-22, 10:52:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Avi's going to arrive with the waist of his pants pulled up to his nipples and super thick glasses
[2023-05-22, 10:52:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: LOL
[2023-05-22, 10:52:48 AM] Santiago: Don’t forget the gut! All my coaches had a gut and crazy good cardio. Prob all muscle in there
[2023-05-22, 10:53:44 AM] Avi Mehrotra: You should meet Indian coaches…
[2023-05-22, 10:54:09 AM] Avi Mehrotra: A good chunk of them fit that exact description
[2023-05-22, 10:54:14 AM] Santiago: Lol
[2023-05-22, 10:54:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: My first coach used to send me drunken messages about philosophy at 2am.
[2023-05-22, 10:54:47 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Not creepy.
[2023-05-22, 10:55:10 AM] Santiago: Btw - I’m planning on pulling the trigger on a propenn case next time I go to R&R. $135 + maybe 10% off
[2023-05-22, 10:55:15 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: He was so fucking weird. I was 14. Bless Daniel 😂. What a man
[2023-05-22, 10:55:19 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Do it
[2023-05-22, 10:55:27 AM] Avi Mehrotra: DUNLOOOOOOOOOPPPPS
[2023-05-22, 10:55:30 AM] Avi Mehrotra: COME ON.
[2023-05-22, 10:55:40 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'd rather the Dunlop's 😂
[2023-05-22, 10:55:53 AM] Santiago: We would save 20+ %.
[2023-05-22, 10:56:19 AM] Santiago: They didn’t have enough in stock. Fuck it, let’s do propenn
[2023-05-22, 10:56:25 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds good
[2023-05-22, 10:56:37 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thanks for grabbing them
[2023-05-22, 10:56:42 AM] Avi Mehrotra: ‎POLL:
Balls?
‎OPTION: The glorious dunlop AO (2 votes)
‎OPTION: The sad pathetic excuse for a tennis ball called propenns (2 votes)
[2023-05-22, 10:56:51 AM] Santiago: Maybe treat ourselves to a can Dunlop here and there
[2023-05-22, 10:56:58 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmao
[2023-05-22, 10:57:30 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: If you're playing tournaments we should probably use propenn. Let's grab Dunlop's next time for the winter season
[2023-05-22, 10:58:09 AM] Santiago: If one of you guys finds a case of Dunlop ready to ship for less than $145, I don’t care. Otherwise, let’s just a make a decision and not beat around the bush so much
[2023-05-22, 10:58:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I hate being in a tennis group with highly educated intellectuals… Always making perfect sense and being totally reasonable. Assholes.
[2023-05-22, 10:59:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: That awkward moment when the average level of education in your sports group is absurdly high
[2023-05-22, 10:59:40 AM] Santiago: Might grab them next weekend 🫡. Will send the bill
[2023-05-22, 11:01:57 AM] Santiago: Also propenn are slightly cheaper 👀
[2023-05-22, 11:04:43 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Also, what’s the plan today? Tennis, go home, shower and reconvene at your place?
[2023-05-22, 11:05:29 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Extra duty marathons right
[2023-05-22, 11:05:43 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was just going to bring a change of clothing. Don't really have time to head back to Burnaby
[2023-05-22, 11:08:35 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Fair
[2023-05-22, 11:37:47 AM] Santiago: Honestly, feel free to shower and or change here. make it easy for everyone. Also, let’s just do the Thai curry and save the Indian dish for some other time. I got most of the ingredients ready to roll. Just need misc veg 👀
[2023-05-22, 11:38:17 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds goooood
[2023-05-22, 11:38:24 AM] Santiago: Also bring your bikinis in case the pool is empty
[2023-05-22, 11:38:48 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Did you all want to stop by the grocery store on the way over to your place and just grab veg?
[2023-05-22, 11:39:31 AM] Santiago: There is a t&t right across the street. Just head there and I’ll get things started
[2023-05-22, 11:40:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ezpz
[2023-05-22, 11:56:48 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Ezpz indeed

[2023-05-24, 9:43:36 AM] Santiago: Should we extend the invite out to Abbey or josh?
[2023-05-24, 10:02:09 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I asked Abbey, he’s not keen on Granville.
[2023-05-24, 10:02:50 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Tbh I’m down for Stanley park. Just might have to start slightly later
[2023-05-24, 10:03:53 AM] Santiago: I’m fine either way. SP is sexier. @16472039624, you down to start early? I gotta be back to work at a reasonable time

[2023-05-29, 4:40:28 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: End was a 5k descent from Seymour into Deep Cove, which just ended up being a suicidal dash down a mountain trying to overtake people. Tons of fun. Much faster race than I've done previously
[2023-05-29, 7:41:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh wow sounds like a tonne of fun that’s awesome 😎
[2023-05-29, 7:42:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also! Did anyone get in touch with R and R about the case of balls?

[2023-06-07, 10:45:22 AM] Avi Mehrotra: ^Same, I’ve gotta be in the lab and prepare a presentation
[2023-06-07, 12:14:03 PM] Santiago: I’ll prob eat beforehand and join for a bit ☀️

Vasek was playing at Stanley Park the other day. We should go challenge him 😂
[2023-06-08, 3:15:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ooooh DAMN! That’s awesome, I feel like we might actually win a couple games hehehehe 🫡
[2023-06-08, 3:16:45 PM] Santiago: I’ll be the ball boy 🫡🫡🫡
[2023-06-08, 3:18:18 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If we played 1000 games in a row and I went for only first serves I think I'd eventually win 1 😂
[2023-06-08, 3:18:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: More like the ball Daddy 🫦 

But like if we’re doing doubles we’d definitely stand a chance of a game
[2023-06-08, 11:03:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Lol remember when he won that match last year and tossed to ball at us? And we fucking dropped it?
[2023-06-08, 11:04:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Wow, that was a memory I had shovelled into the darkest corner of my brain
[2023-06-08, 11:04:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Ooops
[2023-06-08, 11:05:11 PM] Avi Mehrotra: We could ask for another shot at closer range when in Stanley park lol

[2023-06-24, 6:49:03 AM] Santiago: Seems like There are some courts available tomorrow afternoon at SP if anyone is interested 👀
[2023-06-24, 8:12:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I got bumped to today and Avi got the lights cut on him at 5-3 in the 3rd 😂
[2023-06-24, 8:12:32 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: At midnight
[2023-06-24, 8:16:24 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The scheduling was so bad. They didn't let me know I wasn't playing until 10:30
[2023-06-24, 8:17:19 AM] Santiago: Wow! That’s a shit hour to start at too tho
[2023-06-24, 8:18:07 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah, but I just wanted to get on at that point
[2023-06-24, 12:15:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: Daaaamn, how did you both do? Won??
[2023-06-24, 12:16:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I played like a pussy in the second set and lost it. And am up 5-3 in the 3rd
[2023-06-24, 12:17:02 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m better at breaking the guys serve than holding my own
[2023-06-24, 12:17:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And I’ve started to realize/remember what a different beast tournament play is.
[2023-06-24, 12:18:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Adrian plays today. He’s gonna rip his opponents head off.
[2023-06-24, 1:33:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: No I lost lol
[2023-06-24, 1:34:23 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Came out tight, went down 4-0. Came back to 5-4, lost. 2nd set I just shit away a game hitting 3 doubles and the guy didn't miss 1st serve
[2023-06-24, 1:41:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Oh damn
[2023-06-24, 1:41:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 🤷
[2023-06-24, 1:50:11 PM] Santiago: Well, We have a court tomorrow at 1230 SP for some dingles. Got 3ppl ATM
[2023-06-24, 1:50:33 PM] Santiago: Yep tournament energy is super different
[2023-06-24, 1:56:54 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Maybe lol
[2023-06-24, 1:57:11 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Need to convince myself to not quit for a few hours 😂
[2023-06-24, 2:07:31 PM] Santiago: Also, Wimbledon is next month. When do you leave @16472039624? Let’s try to lock down a date for some viewing. Get Abbey out before he departs
[2023-06-24, 2:07:54 PM] Santiago: July 3 - 16
[2023-06-24, 2:08:55 PM] Santiago: I can host or maybe we can go back to your events room 👀
[2023-06-24, 2:23:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Would love to do that
[2023-06-24, 2:44:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea I’m down to host a semi at mine sometime in the middle of July, I leave the 12th! The semis might be on the 14th or so, but I can book the social room at mine!
[2023-06-24, 2:49:05 PM] Santiago: The 7-9th weekend? 👀
[2023-06-24, 2:49:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m in! I’m oncall but should be no sweat 😅
‎[2023-06-24, 2:50:45 PM] Santiago: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-06-24, 2:51:44 PM] Santiago: I guess we’ll have to wait on the exact time(s) or watch a recording?
[2023-06-24, 2:53:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea fuck tournaments are just sooo different to our kinda hitting 😫
[2023-06-24, 2:53:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: The guy sounds consistent tho!
[2023-06-24, 3:49:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Similar game to you actually. Just a righty.
[2023-06-24, 7:49:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Won 6-1, 6-3
[2023-06-24, 7:50:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Actually played like I usually do and that worked well
[2023-06-24, 7:50:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Nice breather after yesterday
[2023-06-24, 7:50:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Great work
[2023-06-24, 7:50:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-06-24, 8:02:29 PM] Santiago: Coach @16047827064 🫡
[2023-06-24, 8:02:37 PM] Santiago: Opponent?
[2023-06-24, 8:23:58 PM] Santiago: Have you played both 4.0 and 4.5 matches?
[2023-06-24, 9:03:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: He's 6-2 4-6 5-3 in his 4.5 match rn 😂
[2023-06-24, 9:03:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: And finishes tomorrow
[2023-06-24, 10:13:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I intend to finish it in 4 straight points. No fucking around.
[2023-06-24, 10:13:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 11-9 in a tie breaker incoming
[2023-06-24, 10:14:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Today I played this guy from north van called Faiyaz Moosa. Went to Sauder around the time you graduated Santiago
[2023-06-24, 10:14:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Same year I think
[2023-06-24, 10:14:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No sir. Not happening.
[2023-06-24, 10:15:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I think I fixed my serve. I was dropping bombs today.
[2023-06-24, 10:15:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Thanks to your tip about tossing higher
[2023-06-24, 10:15:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It was really obvious watching from the side
[2023-06-24, 10:15:53 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You were hitting the ball 6 inches lower than your max
[2023-06-24, 10:16:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah, under pressure I was just being stupid and rushing
[2023-06-24, 10:16:57 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I understand this intimately 🥲
[2023-06-24, 10:17:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I wish I had been awake to come see your match
[2023-06-24, 10:17:25 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I didn't hit a single double until the 2nd set. Realized this. And immediately hit 3 and dunked the set
[2023-06-24, 10:17:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Same lol
[2023-06-24, 10:17:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I was so wired from all the caffeinated gels that I fell asleep at 4
[2023-06-24, 10:18:11 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Biggest problem is I wasn't hitting my FH. Played too much defense.
[2023-06-24, 10:18:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Fuck hahaha
[2023-06-24, 10:18:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah I take non caff gels
[2023-06-24, 10:18:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Fair. Your forehands are bomb lately
[2023-06-24, 10:18:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Until todayyy
[2023-06-24, 10:18:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The coffee flavoured gu gel is absolutely delicious
[2023-06-24, 10:19:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Really. I hate those things hahahah
[2023-06-24, 10:19:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just all of them.
[2023-06-24, 10:19:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The lemon flavoured one was abhorrent
[2023-06-24, 10:19:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Bahahah
[2023-06-24, 10:19:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You gots to play more tournaments brother
[2023-06-24, 10:20:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 100% the issue
[2023-06-24, 10:20:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You’re a god at practice and but match play is a diff beast
[2023-06-24, 10:21:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Chazz asked me to play some time. I want to play him again with a proper warmup
[2023-06-24, 10:51:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Chaz?
[2023-06-24, 10:51:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Guy I playes
[2023-06-24, 10:52:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: My moneys on you
[2023-06-24, 10:53:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I feel like the only thing he has me beat on was mentality
[2023-06-24, 10:54:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Or just tournament readiness
[2023-06-24, 10:54:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yaaa
[2023-06-24, 10:56:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I need to sleep on things. Might sign up for Stanley Park. I'm just also doing a race then. 🤷.
[2023-06-24, 10:57:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: DO ITTTTT
[2023-06-24, 10:57:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: LETS GOOOOOO

[2023-06-24, 10:58:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Like tomorrow
[2023-06-24, 10:59:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Biggest issue is that week 1 is probably:Friday night match. Saturday morning wake up at 5am and fucking run 25km up and down Seymour.
[2023-06-24, 11:00:06 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You can schedule around unavailability on a particular day I think
[2023-06-24, 11:09:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: We will seeee
[2023-06-25, 8:05:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Apparently sign up is today, so I will not be signing up.
[2023-06-25, 8:05:18 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Avi you need to though
[2023-06-25, 11:19:10 AM] Avi Mehrotra: :(
[2023-06-25, 12:14:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Doubles anyone?
[2023-06-25, 12:18:03 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Question: should I play 4.0, 4.5 or open? 2 out of 3 options…
[2023-06-25, 12:25:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You'd get smacked around in open. Youd be better doing 4.5 and 4.5 doubs
[2023-06-25, 12:25:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Stanley Park is always Stacked.
[2023-06-25, 12:25:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Open has atp level
‎[2023-06-25, 2:14:09 PM] Avi Mehrotra: ‎image omitted
[2023-06-25, 2:14:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: LOL
[2023-06-25, 2:15:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Won the last game in 0 points 😂
[2023-06-25, 2:15:16 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is good.
[2023-06-25, 2:16:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm not around tonight unfortunately, so i can't warm you up. You should hit up Brian or Leo though
[2023-06-25, 2:16:53 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No worries at all man
[2023-06-25, 2:17:19 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Brian is playing at 4
[2023-06-25, 2:17:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Man’s got bleeding blisters all over his hand
[2023-06-25, 2:17:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ah shit I was hoping he'd get another day. His hand is shreded
[2023-06-25, 2:17:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Hope he makes it
[2023-06-25, 2:17:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah
[2023-06-25, 2:18:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: His opponent yesterday was terrible, but he could barely hold his racket
[2023-06-25, 2:18:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah I hung out with him for a bit after his match.
[2023-06-25, 2:18:43 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Was in good spirits. Really nice guy
[2023-06-25, 2:19:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I really like Brian. He's going to be an absolute demon next year
[2023-06-25, 2:19:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: We should have him play with us. He’s really good. Might just raise our level.
[2023-06-25, 2:20:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Every time I play him he gets scarier. He's already= to me at the baseline. I've just been out serving him in our sets
[2023-06-25, 2:22:08 PM] Avi Mehrotra: If I do well in 4.0 there’s a real chance I might play him in the quarterfinals I think
[2023-06-25, 2:22:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You'll win that matchup currently.
[2023-06-25, 2:23:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: But it'd be 🍿
[2023-06-25, 5:34:51 PM] Santiago: I would be down to come out and watch the SP Open matches. Beers and tennis.
[2023-06-25, 5:35:09 PM] Santiago: We on for Tuesday AM?
[2023-06-25, 5:35:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yes, monkey brain wants to smash ball
[2023-06-25, 11:36:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No matches tomorrow. I’m down to play on Tuesday as per usual
[2023-06-26, 7:38:00 AM] Santiago: Woke up with a sore back. Maybe went too hard over the weekend. Also just got booked for an 830 meeting tomorrow. Sadly, I’m maybe for tomorrow 😔. Sorry y’all. Will aim to be there at least for a bit
[2023-06-26, 7:38:28 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: All goood

[2023-07-07, 7:11:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, I’m not expecting we watch live
[2023-07-07, 7:12:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: Which reminds me, anyone have a DAZN/TSN subscription to watch replays? How do folks watch replays normally?
[2023-07-07, 7:12:51 PM] Santiago: Yeah, that’s what I’m thinking … whatevs with me tho. I’ll still come out for the bike ride 🫡
[2023-07-07, 7:13:17 PM] Santiago: Not sure, but happy to pitch in for any service
[2023-07-07, 7:13:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I have a tsn sub
[2023-07-07, 7:14:25 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'd also be keen to play some tennis then watch Wimbledon
[2023-07-07, 7:16:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok sweet, we could just do false creek instead…? The only thing about watching is that my social room is booked, so I can’t host for Wimbledon viewing 😕
[2023-07-07, 7:20:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do False creek
[2023-07-07, 7:21:09 PM] Shardul Bansal: For Saturday that is, but I’ve booked the social room for Sunday
[2023-07-07, 7:25:52 PM] Santiago: So recap: tomorrow SP 8am? and Sunday y’all playing at False creek prior viewing? What time did you book the activities room, senor @16472039624?
[2023-07-07, 7:55:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: Got it for the full day on Sunday, and yeeeep that sounds good 👍
[2023-07-07, 8:12:27 PM] Santiago: Sounds good! Or would you rather play at FC tomorrow? Not sure if I’ll join for tennis on Sunday, but will be there for the viewing. Just let me know when you want us to show up 🫡
[2023-07-07, 8:16:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: Avi, wanna do False Creek tomorrow?

[2023-07-09, 7:36:55 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm looking through the tsn app and I'm not sure we will be to watch things back. Not seeing any on demand tennis showings
[2023-07-09, 8:33:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: Maybe we can use an illegal option 🤷‍♂️
[2023-07-09, 8:35:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The bublik Rublev match is going so long we'll probably catch Novak vs Hubi

[2023-07-09, 8:47:35 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll have to grab bread for myself but that sounds good for a post tennis lunch
[2023-07-09, 8:48:13 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was also toying with the idea of either a paragon or Modus trip after tennis for a drink.
[2023-07-09, 9:01:44 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ll be a bit late. Flat tire

[2023-08-01, 6:04:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ve only played him a handful of times so you’d be a better judge of his level than me

[2023-08-19, 9:20:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Did the guy feel playable?
[2023-08-19, 9:20:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Oh yeah.
[2023-08-19, 9:20:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It was on serve in the second set till like 4 all
[2023-08-19, 9:20:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: Which is crazy because he’s 15 and straight from India, was top 50 there 👀👀👀
[2023-08-19, 9:20:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And then I kinda just crashed
[2023-08-19, 9:20:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh nice.
[2023-08-19, 9:21:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Avi playing a younger version of  himself
[2023-08-19, 9:21:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: He was a really nice kid. Just chatting with him brought back so much nostalgia
[2023-08-19, 9:21:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: He was really solid though.
[2023-08-19, 9:22:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Cool to see. I remember I played the top kid of my year in BC and just got absolutely stomped when I was like 15
[2023-08-19, 9:22:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Won 1 game off big serves
‎[2023-08-19, 9:29:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎image omitted
[2023-08-19, 9:30:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So now we know what Adrian is doing this weekend
[2023-08-19, 9:30:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Weooop. Next year 🤔
[2023-08-19, 9:30:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Okay. Let’s take a step back and analyse Shardul’s match from my perspective:
[2023-08-19, 9:31:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Our boy here was playing some aggressive tennis. He was rushing the net well and actually making some solid volleys. Don’t listen to his modesty.
[2023-08-19, 9:32:16 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You’ve been working on that part of your game and you actually managed to use that in a match.
[2023-08-19, 9:32:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: THAT. IS. PROGRESS. BITCH
[2023-08-19, 9:33:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Nice nice. What would it be like to have variety in your game? Such a crazy concept
[2023-08-19, 9:33:43 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Compared to 6 months ago when Shardul would retreat back to the baseline from the service line after a short ball
[2023-08-19, 9:33:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 😂
[2023-08-19, 9:47:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: Bro humans are crazy
[2023-08-19, 9:47:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also you know that human which is also crazy
‎[2023-08-19, 9:49:50 PM] Santiago: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-08-19, 10:17:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The hardest workout I routinely do is play keep up with Mark in the forest.
[2023-08-20, 12:40:45 PM] Santiago: Tuesday AM?
[2023-08-20, 12:57:35 PM] Santiago: How the games going gents?
[2023-08-20, 5:05:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Can't Tues, any other days good though
[2023-08-20, 5:33:59 PM] Santiago: Wednesday?
[2023-08-20, 6:22:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's gooo
[2023-08-20, 7:16:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Wednesday it is
[2023-08-20, 7:16:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You win today?
[2023-08-20, 7:16:56 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No match. Next match is on Friday??
[2023-08-20, 7:17:01 PM] Avi Mehrotra: At 9pm?
[2023-08-20, 7:17:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's... Very far away
[2023-08-20, 7:17:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: These organizers are not very good at organizing
[2023-08-20, 7:17:26 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: A classic.
[2023-08-20, 7:17:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like Burnaby
[2023-08-20, 7:17:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No this is much worse.
[2023-08-20, 7:17:59 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Fucking hell 😂
[2023-08-20, 7:18:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I wonder how Shardul did today
[2023-08-20, 7:18:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: He had a match at 5
[2023-08-21, 8:44:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: I did not do well, forgot how to play tennis on the court 😞
[2023-08-21, 8:44:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly just need some tournament practice, it’s so different to just hitting
[2023-08-21, 8:53:26 PM] Santiago: Word!
[2023-08-21, 8:54:18 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: First tournament in years right? It's super different. I played at a solid C level in Burnaby. 

Your levels been super high in practice. You've also developed your game a lot even since we met. I think next season if you consistently go into tournaments you'll make some deep runs
[2023-08-21, 8:54:34 PM] Santiago: You are champ in my eyes, bro ❤️
[2023-08-21, 9:11:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: Thanks gents, I appreciate the gassss, I literally forgot how to hit a down the line forehand in the match, couldn’t do very much properly but oh well, at least we’re back out there 🤷‍♂️
[2023-08-21, 9:11:59 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Pro tip: Forgetting how to hit your favorite shot is not a key to success.
[2023-08-21, 9:12:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's super frustrating though. Was the guy good?
[2023-08-21, 9:14:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ehhhh, not really
[2023-08-21, 9:14:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: He did have a decent forehand, could dictate the point but everything I was hitting was landing short
‎[2023-08-21, 9:15:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-08-21, 9:17:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Anything we should try to work on then? Try to put you on offense?
[2023-08-21, 9:50:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly down for more movement  and footwork related drills, I felt like I was carrying a couple of blocks of cement on my feet
[2023-08-21, 10:02:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Maybe we'll try to throw a footwork drill in Wednesday morning between warm-up and point play. I'll try to think of something
[2023-08-21, 10:15:45 PM] Santiago: Honestly, i feel like we should aim for true match play every time all 4 of us show up. Play a full set and switch partners the following week. Learn to shake off the nerves. Leave the drills for the threesome days
[2023-08-22, 10:40:03 AM] Avi Mehrotra: YES.
[2023-08-22, 2:00:55 PM] Santiago: We still on for tomorrow AM?
[2023-08-22, 2:01:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m tentative, I got a concert tonight that id forgotten about
[2023-08-22, 2:05:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm in for tomorrow
[2023-08-22, 5:24:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m in.
[2023-08-22, 9:35:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: There's a chance of showers in the morning. Should we do Thursday instead?
[2023-08-22, 9:43:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Risk it
[2023-08-22, 9:43:54 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Okay, but if it's dry in Burnaby and raining in Van we are playing in the rain
[2023-08-22, 9:44:09 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Obviously?
[2023-08-22, 11:18:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sorry gents I’m out tomorrow, just need a lil rest
[2023-08-23, 5:14:58 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Well it's dry out
[2023-08-23, 6:22:50 AM] Santiago: 🫡🫡🫡
[2023-08-23, 6:23:13 AM] Santiago: Bruh, you up at 5ish 😖?
[2023-08-23, 6:24:39 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Gotta leave my house at 6 to get there for 6:45, so yes lol
[2023-08-23, 6:24:53 AM] Santiago: 🥲
[2023-08-23, 6:25:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: 🙃
[2023-08-23, 6:25:05 AM] Santiago: Appreciate the effort 🫡
[2023-08-23, 6:25:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was so tired I passed out at like 9:30 last night anyways 😂
[2023-08-23, 6:27:06 AM] Santiago: @16047827064, you reading this???
[2023-08-23, 6:51:53 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Not until now
‎[2023-08-23, 3:24:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎video omitted
[2023-08-23, 3:26:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Looking at this now @16138999983 you jump but you're actually falling when you hit the ball.

[2023-08-23, 3:33:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can stop micro analyzing your serve if it's annoying lmao. I am just running code at work.
[2023-08-23, 3:47:49 PM] Santiago: Thx @17788869646! Good stuff!
[2023-08-23, 3:48:53 PM] Santiago: I have been trying to find the voluntary motion that gets me the right flow. I might just need to grab a basket of balls and hit serve with a good focus on hips and launch
[2023-08-23, 3:51:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: There's a lot of good stuff to pick out on your serve tbh. your contact is consistent despite your legs being too complex. You have a smooth motion up top, you pronate well. 

I literally think you should work on just hitting serves without moving your feet at all. I think you'd get more power and spin with that alone.
[2023-08-23, 5:12:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: This is awesome analysis Adrian! Very kewl and also Santiago you generate nearly all of your serve speed from your arm eh 💪

Would love to see that video analysis for all the boys 👀
[2023-08-23, 5:51:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll try to get some footage of all of us serving. And some when Santiago is actually warmed up.  I've filmed myself a little bit, it really helps when you're trying to tweek your shots a little.
[2023-08-23, 5:51:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also thanks!
[2023-08-23, 6:02:28 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I can’t unsee @16138999983 literally kicking himself in the ass as he serves
[2023-08-23, 6:04:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I actually think he doesn't do that enough. Watch where the right foot is when he lands. It's counterbalancing sideways.
[2023-08-23, 6:05:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Like you're supposed to kinda land with the right foot kicked up. That happens a bit too early and he's forced to kick to the side to compensate.
[2023-08-23, 6:06:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Actually watching my serve I'm kicking too far out right too.
[2023-08-23, 6:06:26 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Or I'm more twisted into the court than I should be
[2023-08-23, 6:09:16 PM] Avi Mehrotra: That’s after hitting the ball though, almost as a counterbalance to compensate for the force you’re transferring forward, to not fall over
[2023-08-23, 6:09:44 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Okay what kick are you referring to?
[2023-08-23, 6:10:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m talking about the jerk of the right foot as he launches himself up in the air

[2023-08-23, 6:12:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Go nuts
[2023-08-23, 6:13:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: When I get home I'll micro analyze.
[2023-08-23, 6:13:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll also roast my serves

[2023-08-23, 6:15:04 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I agree
[2023-08-23, 7:45:36 PM] Santiago: Yesssir! Great analysis gents!
[2023-08-23, 7:46:30 PM] Santiago: Alberto was getting me to put my feet together and swing without moving them. Great exercise!
[2023-08-23, 7:47:56 PM] Santiago: I feel like the quality of @16472039624 serve relies heavily on his moan
[2023-08-23, 7:57:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: yeah 100% what i'd have you do
‎[2023-08-23, 7:57:59 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎image omitted
[2023-08-23, 8:05:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm going to have to mega nitpick to really critique your serve @16047827064  It's obvious a very good serve.

[2023-08-23, 8:19:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Although I think that the way you step through on your right foot causes your hips to be a little more turned into the court, which make the outwide serve on the ad side, as well as heavy kicks to that side harder to hit.
[2023-08-23, 8:20:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Usually with a kick serve you want to be orthogonal to the baseline. You can obviously hit the shot, but as a returner it's typically not the serve i'm fearing from you even though it's to my weaker side.

[2023-08-23, 8:23:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: going to have food now
[2023-08-23, 8:40:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’d pay good money (when I have it after my PhD) for you to be my coach
[2023-08-23, 8:41:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: But again, A LOT of those problems are solved by a higher toss, except for loading, where I’m opening up to the court too much.
[2023-08-23, 8:42:11 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm being incredibly nitpicky. I literally feel like you could workout the few kinks you have by taking a basket of balls and working your kick out wide
[2023-08-23, 8:42:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It’s effective for a slice serve, but damaging to a kick serve
[2023-08-23, 8:42:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Like you so nicely explained
[2023-08-23, 8:42:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think the loading is actually fine, it just means your torso needs to be twisted a little because your hips are less perpendicular to the baseline.
[2023-08-23, 8:43:28 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It wasn’t always like this though.
[2023-08-23, 8:43:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: When did you learn to load like that?

[2023-08-23, 8:50:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Avi at 15
[2023-08-23, 8:50:42 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Have fun
[2023-08-23, 8:51:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is cute 😂
[2023-08-23, 8:56:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I need to find footage of my FH from like 2009. It's a silly shot
[2023-08-23, 8:57:07 PM] Santiago: On a separate note, anyone down for a Saturday AM?
[2023-08-23, 8:59:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I don't think I'll be able to unfortunately
[2023-08-23, 9:24:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Okay, i'm going to stare at Shardul's serve now
‎[2023-08-23, 9:40:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎image omitted
[2023-08-23, 9:41:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also this does a good job to highlight Avi's crazy good knee bend. You have your knees a full foot into the court, compared to Shadul who is at the baseline.
‎[2023-08-23, 9:55:26 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎image omitted
[2023-08-23, 9:58:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You also have a habit of moving your front foot a little when you're loading. (I also do this sometimes). This has gotten much better though. I remember you were practically walking around 6 months ago. Now it's just a small stutter step that's barely visible.
[2023-08-23, 10:03:11 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Otherwise your motions super nice tbh. I think everything is in the toss. Your takeback is super simple, you have no weird hitches or twists. You could maybe jump into it more, but I think that's more a function of being forced to wait to hit the ball than the motion itself.
[2023-08-23, 10:25:53 PM] Avi Mehrotra: *Slow Claps*
[2023-08-23, 10:27:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Do forehands next
[2023-08-23, 10:27:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Oooh I want to do forehands next
[2023-08-23, 10:27:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Gotta get some good footage of all of us.
[2023-08-23, 10:27:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also yeah I'd love to see it.
[2023-08-23, 10:27:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Everyone send me videos of your forehands
[2023-08-23, 10:28:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll breakdown my own serve tomorrow. It's cool contrasting all of them. I generate my power in a pretty different way than you do off the serve.
[2023-08-23, 10:30:21 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Adrian, you generate so much power from just wrist snap, it’s crazy.
[2023-08-23, 10:32:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Though your toss has improved a LOT in the past year and a half, the jerky motion leading up to the trophy position adds a little unnecessary variability to your toss. You know this, this isn’t new.
[2023-08-23, 10:34:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It used to be that both your arms use to go up at the same time, but now you’ve slowed down your right arm.
[2023-08-23, 10:34:57 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Do the same thing for the left.
[2023-08-23, 10:36:05 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I actually think you’d stand to benefit a lot from tossing a bit higher, bending down, loading, jumping and unloading.
[2023-08-23, 10:36:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: That way you could really leverage your height.
[2023-08-23, 10:36:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And we wouldn’t even see your set
[2023-08-23, 10:36:28 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Serve
[2023-08-23, 10:41:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Did you notice the little hitch in my motion?
[2023-08-23, 10:42:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Detangling the left and the right hands been huge for my serve.
[2023-08-23, 10:45:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Leo kinda points this out at the end of the video I sent: " it's crazy how much power you get barely jumping".
[2023-08-23, 10:46:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll try to smooth out the left. I wonder if starting the toss motion lower down might help.
[2023-08-23, 10:47:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yes.
[2023-08-23, 10:48:09 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Coz you’ll have all that time to develop momentum
[2023-08-23, 10:48:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: We should deliberately work at this next time.
[2023-08-23, 10:49:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tomorrow.
[2023-08-23, 10:49:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 😁😁😁😁
[2023-08-23, 10:49:43 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You know you want to
[2023-08-23, 10:50:05 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Serve clinic. All the videos.
[2023-08-23, 10:50:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Then forehands
[2023-08-23, 10:52:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Im busy sadly 🙃
[2023-08-24, 7:22:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: Interesting, so needing to wait for the ball to drop and staying in my loading position slows my serve down? 

I’m also not hitting the ball anywhere near to the apex of the throw, it’s already on its way down which probably makes timing of my hit needlessly difficult 😞
[2023-08-24, 7:23:35 AM] Shardul Bansal: Soooo simple but crazy fast
[2023-08-24, 7:25:14 AM] Shardul Bansal: THIS ^^^^ 

This is my biggest concern with my serve, holy shit Adrian you’re good
[2023-08-24, 7:25:16 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's like If you were to go and pitch a baseball, but you pause for a second with your arm up and cocked back. You lose momentum. 

You can get away with this by loading more and pronating faster though. There's pros with super high tosses. But the best servers (think Kyrgios) have everything as one smooth motion
[2023-08-24, 7:29:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: Dude I’m curious to know if I still do this, this video is also 3 months old at least, we should re-film 👀👀
[2023-08-24, 7:30:15 AM] Shardul Bansal: That and the fact that I’m loading not nearly as much as I could which would greatly improve my jump into the serve
[2023-08-24, 7:30:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: Very true
[2023-08-24, 7:38:36 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Your serve was looking way better last time we played I thought
[2023-08-24, 7:38:59 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think you could make a ton of gains by just working on your toss.
[2023-08-24, 7:39:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Having it drop 1 foot rather than 3 before you hit.
[2023-08-25, 11:32:38 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Won in 3 sets today. Forehand non existent. I basically played on a backhand and a serve.
[2023-08-26, 7:08:44 AM] Santiago: Yesssir!!! Did you throw some slices in there?
[2023-08-26, 7:52:34 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: You should start working on serve and volleying more for when this happens. Just like plan B, forehand 1+2 game isn't working, it's time to be at the net.
[2023-08-26, 9:40:09 AM] Avi Mehrotra: You know it
[2023-08-26, 9:40:27 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Playing Josh melton at 2
[2023-08-26, 9:40:53 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Y’all should come watch
[2023-08-26, 9:41:32 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Guess that’s what we’re working on Tuesday
[2023-08-26, 10:05:55 AM] Santiago: I’ll be able to hear it from here 👂
[2023-08-26, 10:46:43 AM] Avi Mehrotra: LOL
[2023-08-26, 11:02:51 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I feel like I'm missing something lol
[2023-08-26, 11:31:51 AM] Avi Mehrotra: He yells. A lot.
[2023-08-26, 11:32:29 AM] Avi Mehrotra: He was the really loud tall dude playing next to me in Burnaby
[2023-08-26, 4:21:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Almost passed out on the court it was so hot
[2023-08-26, 4:31:45 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yes holy hell Im absolutely smoked after my run.
[2023-08-26, 4:31:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Did he tell?
[2023-08-26, 4:31:54 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yell*
[2023-08-26, 4:32:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Nah
[2023-08-26, 4:32:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: He was pretty chill throughout
[2023-08-26, 4:32:45 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: How was the match?
[2023-08-26, 4:33:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I retired before the first set finished
[2023-08-26, 4:33:20 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I was getting dizzy
[2023-08-26, 4:33:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And suffocating in the heat
[2023-08-26, 4:33:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: Fuckkk it is soooo warm
[2023-08-26, 4:34:45 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I feel like this is like poor nutrition or sleep beforehand more than fitness
[2023-08-26, 4:53:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I slept well. I ate decently. It was that I couldn’t tolerate the heat. Felt like I was getting broiled.
[2023-08-27, 1:12:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Anyone keen to come to Burnaby today to hit? 😘
[2023-08-27, 1:41:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: I need some rest this weekend, I’m out 😞

[2023-08-28, 11:25:00 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Honestly if the weather is good i'd love to hit a ball in the morning then. I have an unfortunately late work day Thursday which kinda mucks the whole thing otherwise 🙃
[2023-08-28, 11:47:15 AM] Shardul Bansal: Very down for a Tuesday and Thursday hit this week

We were supposed to play another day but rescheduled because of rain.
[2023-08-30, 10:22:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Damnnn, it did indeed turn into a beautiful day so fair enough

[2023-08-31, 10:47:28 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Brian's going to join us, i'll try to get Leo (although he hates early mornings). We were thinking of trying a casual round robin style tournament. Two groups of 3, you play the other two people in your group. Then maybe top from each group plays eachother in a finals or something?
[2023-08-31, 12:06:28 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Let’s do it

[2023-09-11, 7:46:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: https://www.startlinetiming.com/en/races/2023/finlayson/event/28K

I came 13th/216 in my run. Getting faster

[2023-09-11, 9:55:11 PM] Santiago: Assuming courts stay dry
[2023-09-11, 9:55:29 PM] Santiago: 👑👑👑
[2023-09-11, 10:07:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: Richmond?? Or UBC??
[2023-09-11, 10:08:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: Dude this is incredible
[2023-09-11, 10:08:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Wow 😯
[2023-09-11, 10:10:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://www.coastlineendurancerunning.com/finlayson-arm-races/
[2023-09-11, 10:10:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: This is truly incredible, feats of endurance I did not think were possible
[2023-09-11, 10:28:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's constantly surprising me what people can do. The whole trail running scene is pretty nuts.
[2023-09-11, 10:28:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hyped to hit a ball Wednesday. Haven't played in over a week now.
[2023-09-11, 10:31:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: UBC
[2023-09-11, 10:31:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The fast courts that I loved and you really hated are gone.
[2023-09-11, 10:41:25 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Those were aweful
[2023-09-11, 10:41:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: But cheap
[2023-09-11, 10:41:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: So 🤷
[2023-09-11, 10:47:56 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Still cheap
[2023-09-11, 10:48:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh dang
[2023-09-11, 10:48:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Guess you’re gonna have to make the trip to UBC like the good old days
[2023-09-11, 10:48:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If that's what it takes.
[2023-09-11, 10:49:03 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Take up a TA contract for a term
[2023-09-11, 10:49:03 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's less bad now. I don't live in the middle of fucking nowhere
[2023-09-11, 10:49:06 PM] Avi Mehrotra: lol
[2023-09-11, 10:49:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Eww no 😂

[2023-09-11, 11:18:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yay?
[2023-09-12, 8:07:32 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh dang, did you actually go to tryouts??
[2023-09-12, 8:08:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyyyy well done Avi!! That’s amazing!
[2023-09-12, 8:14:41 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-09-12, 8:15:15 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Top 11 out of 50. The other 10 people are incredible players.
[2023-09-12, 8:15:21 AM] Avi Mehrotra: All open level
[2023-09-12, 8:15:52 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Wow, 11 open level players is pretty nuts of a turnout
[2023-09-12, 8:16:41 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: If only they hadn't resurfaced that bubble. You could have just served your way to victory
[2023-09-12, 8:16:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea well buddy you’re up there
[2023-09-12, 8:18:00 AM] Santiago: Yesssir! Congrats
[2023-09-12, 8:18:24 AM] Santiago: Hate the idea of having to pay… like bruh, that uni is loaded
[2023-09-12, 9:52:43 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: How many people make the cut in the end?
[2023-09-12, 4:29:57 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Not sure tbh
[2023-09-12, 4:30:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Could be between 4-8
[2023-09-12, 4:30:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like it's potentially doable.
[2023-09-12, 4:30:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: you might need to play out of your mind
[2023-09-12, 4:33:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah absolutely
[2023-09-12, 5:10:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: Avi you joining for tomorrow’s session? Anything you wanna practice before tryouts?
[2023-09-12, 5:32:01 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I might need to get 12 hours of sleep tbh
[2023-09-12, 5:32:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ve been playing well. My footwork has improved. Serving well.
[2023-09-12, 5:33:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: totally fair, good luck G!
[2023-09-12, 5:39:23 PM] Santiago: I might bail tomorrow too. Down to organize something(s) for this Friday AM and/or weekend
[2023-09-12, 6:02:26 PM] Santiago: Best of luck, señor! Looking forward to hearing about it this weekend 🤗
[2023-09-12, 6:33:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Thanks you gents
[2023-09-12, 6:33:21 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Have fun tomorrow
[2023-09-12, 6:33:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Play a few sets
[2023-09-12, 7:18:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: @17788869646 wanna crank out a set tomorrow morning then?
[2023-09-12, 7:18:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: Friday morning I’m down
[2023-09-12, 7:19:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I haven't played for over a week so I'm going to spray balls everywhere, but I'm keen for a hit
[2023-09-12, 7:23:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You’ll be fiiiiiiibe
[2023-09-12, 7:23:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: spray-balls-everywhere was my middle name at Coquitlam
[2023-09-12, 7:24:02 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It'll go, just like maybe into the back wall
[2023-09-12, 7:38:43 PM] Santiago: Don’t give him the side closest to the train tracks 😂
[2023-09-12, 7:46:10 PM] Santiago: @17788869646 Will show up hitting every forehand at 120% and say “just needed a break from tennis”
[2023-09-12, 7:46:27 PM] Santiago: Be careful out there @16472039624
[2023-09-12, 7:46:59 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I actually went to IMG academy in Florida
[2023-09-12, 8:02:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Can’t believe you lied on your Strava for tennis 🫣
[2023-09-12, 8:25:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: When bolletieri was alive?
[2023-09-12, 8:34:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: They have his taxidermied corpse at the entrance
[2023-09-12, 10:58:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So basically when he was 50 years old
[2023-09-13, 5:48:52 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I am conscious, but I'll be there at 7 instead of 6:45
[2023-09-13, 7:00:52 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just walking down from Broadway
[2023-09-13, 10:03:08 PM] Santiago: https://youtube.com/shorts/9J-tes1foOs?si=VSjYl9RCjmArPJJw
[2023-09-13, 10:03:22 PM] Santiago: Dis my new strategy
[2023-09-14, 2:40:17 PM] Santiago: Faack! Gotta bail again tomorrow 😭. Sorry gents!
[2023-09-14, 2:52:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: Absolutely love the headshot to end it ahahahaha
[2023-09-14, 2:52:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m still good to play tomorrow if folks are down?
[2023-09-14, 2:58:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm playing tonight, so probably no go for me
[2023-09-14, 3:04:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: @16047827064 how did your Wednesday tryouts go G?
[2023-09-14, 6:31:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m down.
[2023-09-14, 6:31:43 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No bueno
[2023-09-14, 6:31:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Played like shit.
[2023-09-14, 6:31:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Choked all my forehands
[2023-09-14, 6:32:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: But was serving on point lol
[2023-09-14, 6:45:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: man can literally always rely on serve.
[2023-09-14, 6:46:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: The thing is, your technique and your style of play I’m sure are also a criteria to get into the team, you’ve got a textbook forehand even if it doesn’t land 100% of the time. You might still get in!
[2023-09-14, 6:50:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think they're pretty results based
[2023-09-14, 6:50:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: But maybe 🤷.
[2023-09-14, 6:50:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like it was maybe the brain that was misfiring
[2023-09-14, 6:57:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Indeed.
[2023-09-14, 6:57:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I KEEP FUCKING AROUND WITH MY FOREHAND GRIP.
[2023-09-14, 6:58:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: IF y’all see me hold my racquet with anything but a western grip, you have full permission to launch a ball at me at full speed.
[2023-09-14, 6:58:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I thought you hit semi?
[2023-09-14, 6:58:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Western.
[2023-09-14, 6:59:05 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Not Adrian western
[2023-09-14, 6:59:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What, we need to compare.
[2023-09-14, 6:59:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: But like Djokovic western
[2023-09-14, 6:59:18 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh like the Kyrgios/Ruud grip
[2023-09-14, 6:59:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Interesting
[2023-09-14, 6:59:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Today I but Brian 11-0
[2023-09-14, 6:59:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Beat*
[2023-09-14, 6:59:34 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And he was on fire
[2023-09-14, 6:59:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I couldn’t fucking miss.
[2023-09-14, 6:59:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m so bloody pissed off.
[2023-09-14, 6:59:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's infuriating
[2023-09-14, 7:00:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Means the levels there.
[2023-09-14, 7:00:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Oh well.
[2023-09-14, 7:00:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Next year.
[2023-09-14, 7:00:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You just need to make it so that your floor is that
[2023-09-14, 7:00:27 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: By next year.
[2023-09-14, 7:00:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-09-14, 7:00:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: So even if it's a bad day youre fine
[2023-09-14, 7:01:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m faster on court and these days though.
[2023-09-14, 7:01:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So that’s an improvement
[2023-09-14, 7:02:04 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Also, @16472039624 I have your racquet
[2023-09-15, 9:55:39 AM] Santiago: Gents, anyone interested in playing at SP this Sunday at 1130? I have a court booked, but partner just cancelled
[2023-09-15, 4:50:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: Alas I can’t, would’ve loved to
[2023-09-15, 8:20:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Not sure if this is anyone's jam, but I'm probably going to go do a morning power hike up the Grind tomorrow if anyone wants to join.
‎[2023-09-15, 8:28:48 PM] Santiago: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-09-15, 8:29:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Understandable 😂
[2023-09-15, 8:53:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: *power hike*
[2023-09-15, 8:53:50 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Then proceeds to sprint up the grind in 30 minutes
[2023-09-15, 9:08:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: Damn just getting down from Mt Seymour, I’m out but appreciate the invite, down to join next time
[2023-09-15, 9:19:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Aiming for 38!
[2023-09-15, 9:19:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: All good!
[2023-09-15, 9:21:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: woah, holy my best is a 47, do you RUN up the grind??!
[2023-09-15, 9:22:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 39:50 is my best, but I'm in better shape now. Probably see if I can just do sub 39.
[2023-09-15, 9:23:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I just try to set a pace and do each of the little /40 markers in less than a minute
[2023-09-15, 9:24:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 47 is crazy good on just tennis and gym gains. Damn man
[2023-09-15, 9:33:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: I can’t imagine anything below a 40 I feel like I need to witness this
[2023-09-15, 9:54:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Come join meeee 😂
[2023-09-15, 10:09:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: ORRRR
[2023-09-15, 10:09:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: BIKE RIDE
[2023-09-15, 10:19:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hmmmmm, I think Im rested and want to try to blast up the grind. We should do a group ride at some point though
[2023-09-15, 10:33:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Fine… may the wind be behind you.
[2023-09-15, 10:36:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Wait are winds something to factor in when you’re planning a run? Or is it negligible.
[2023-09-15, 10:36:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: ?*
[2023-09-15, 10:36:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Up the grind not a thing lmao.
[2023-09-15, 10:37:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Over a marathon on the roads absolutely
[2023-09-15, 10:37:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You can draft while running
[2023-09-15, 10:37:44 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Makes sense, given all the trees and all.
[2023-09-16, 12:22:59 PM] Santiago: Honestly, I would be down to plan a ride out to deep cove or horseshoe bay + lunch
[2023-09-16, 12:23:18 PM] Santiago: Shardul could borrow your old bike 👀
[2023-09-16, 12:43:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: YES
[2023-09-16, 12:43:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: LETS DO IT
[2023-09-16, 12:43:59 PM] Avi Mehrotra: This time though, let’s start ever so slightly later in the day
[2023-09-16, 12:44:03 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Say 10 am
[2023-09-16, 11:02:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: imma tennis it up tomorrow gents
[2023-09-18, 3:38:13 PM] Santiago: Anyone down for tennis tomorrow? 👀
[2023-09-18, 3:56:16 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thursday?
[2023-09-18, 3:56:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Can't do tomorrow
[2023-09-18, 4:10:32 PM] Santiago: Let’s aim for Thursday. Weather looks better too
[2023-09-18, 7:24:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: Thursday is ideal
[2023-09-19, 4:23:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tomorrow?
[2023-09-19, 5:00:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think it'll be wet
[2023-09-19, 5:00:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Thursdayyyy
[2023-09-20, 4:55:39 PM] Santiago: 645 tomorrow?
[2023-09-20, 7:03:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: sun doesn’t rise till 7 😢
[2023-09-20, 7:56:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: There’s just something about 6:45 as a time that irks me
[2023-09-20, 7:56:16 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I don’t know why
[2023-09-20, 8:03:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll be there tomorrow. But I might end up hitting with another friend for the session though. She expressed she needed to practise a bit so I offered. She used to play for the UBC team so I'm assuming she's decent
[2023-09-20, 8:10:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: No problemo, @16138999983 wanna also invite Josh so that we’re an even number?
[2023-09-20, 8:19:33 PM] Santiago: 👍🏽
[2023-09-20, 10:33:21 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I hit with Karen and Leo today and holy fuck she’s good. She’s like Leo but consistent.
[2023-09-20, 10:36:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Karen is an absolute boss. She's a great player.
[2023-09-20, 10:36:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Turns out Adrian’s friend is Rebecca Marino lol
[2023-09-20, 10:36:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmao
[2023-09-20, 10:36:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: No, turns out one of my coworkers girlfriends is a tennis player
[2023-09-20, 10:38:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Honestly, if she wants, invite her to our morning hits on the regular. Always good to have more people, ESPECIALLY if they were on the UBC team and can beat our asses.
[2023-09-20, 10:39:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: She's like super done with tennis in general and very introverted. So we'll see.
[2023-09-20, 10:39:45 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I've been trying to get her to come hit for a while lmao
[2023-09-20, 10:40:11 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ve been there… but you never know.
[2023-09-20, 10:40:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's the hope 😁
[2023-09-20, 10:41:01 PM] Avi Mehrotra: But yeah see y’all tomorrow. And see y’all at the Laver cup, where we get to see Papa Federer in the flesh.
[2023-09-21, 6:23:39 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's sooo darkk
[2023-09-21, 7:00:14 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Welcome to the dark side
[2023-09-21, 7:00:27 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Of the seasons…

[2023-09-21, 6:33:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was hoping to see Rublev play singles. This is pretty sweet. Excited to watch Felix.
[2023-09-21, 6:38:20 PM] Avi Mehrotra: MONFILS!!!!
[2023-09-21, 6:38:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I kinda want to go for another sesh
[2023-09-21, 6:40:09 PM] Shardul Bansal: That'll be another 130 fat ones most likely, if not more for the Saturday or Sunday, but totally could be worth it to watch these folks play

[2023-09-22, 4:10:35 PM] Avi Mehrotra: How many courts?
[2023-09-22, 4:10:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Just 4. They were very bad before.
[2023-09-22, 4:11:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Good option for morning hits.
[2023-09-22, 7:25:47 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yo @17788869646  where you at!!?!?!

[2023-09-22, 8:25:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea I have no idea, why did monfils just give up
[2023-09-22, 8:26:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think maybe we were missing some of the talk happening on court

[2023-09-22, 11:58:10 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Join us.
[2023-09-22, 11:58:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Shardul and I are playing lol
[2023-09-22, 11:59:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What time? I have also come to realize I am incredibly sleepy 😅
[2023-09-22, 11:59:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: 8 am
[2023-09-22, 11:59:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It’s supposed to start raining at like 11
[2023-09-22, 11:59:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m also super sleepy, how’s 8:30?
[2023-09-22, 11:59:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So last outdoor hit of the week
[2023-09-23, 12:00:00 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Aghhh I think I might get some rest.
[2023-09-23, 12:00:22 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: If I wake up early I'll come by
[2023-09-23, 12:00:23 AM] Avi Mehrotra: The rublev grunt didn’t get your juices going?
[2023-09-23, 12:00:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh it did.
[2023-09-23, 12:00:46 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: False Creek?
[2023-09-23, 12:00:51 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessir
[2023-09-23, 12:01:15 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Or we can do someplace that’s more convenient?
[2023-09-23, 12:01:16 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: 50% chance I wake up at 7 anyways.
[2023-09-23, 12:01:18 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Nah
[2023-09-23, 12:01:28 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Queen E if Shardul’s down for it
[2023-09-23, 12:01:39 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: False Creek is ezpz
[2023-09-23, 12:01:44 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Okay cool
[2023-09-23, 12:02:10 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Tbh tonight I was more concentrated on RF than either of the matches
[2023-09-23, 12:02:26 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmao
[2023-09-23, 12:02:41 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The end of the doubs match was great
[2023-09-23, 12:03:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: That Arthur Fils kid needs to work on his net game. I was gonna send Shardul on court to show him how it’s done
[2023-09-23, 12:03:37 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Bahahaha
[2023-09-23, 12:03:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: Stahhhppp why am I involved in the crossfire here
[2023-09-23, 12:03:59 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: He improved a lot through the match.
[2023-09-23, 12:04:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m just tryna return my mobi bike so I can get some sleep but the damn thing won’t work
[2023-09-23, 12:04:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: He's got a hammer of a FH
[2023-09-23, 12:04:08 AM] Avi Mehrotra: This was a compliment to your new skills in every way.
[2023-09-23, 12:04:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Oh dang
[2023-09-23, 12:04:22 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, but he totally lacked the experience to know when to use it I feel
[2023-09-23, 12:04:27 AM] Avi Mehrotra: And he tosses to the moon before serving
[2023-09-23, 12:04:45 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I legit wanted to shout toss higher
[2023-09-23, 12:05:23 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Question: why the fuck do they not have legit doubles players on the rosters?
[2023-09-23, 12:05:55 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Like a seasoned team? Think along the lines of peak Nestor and Zimonjic
[2023-09-23, 12:07:46 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Not as much of a draw
[2023-09-23, 12:08:36 AM] Avi Mehrotra: What do you mean?
[2023-09-23, 12:08:50 AM] Santiago: Might join tomorrow if I wake up early(and we got 4) assuming invite is extended
[2023-09-23, 12:10:28 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Always by default, my friend.
[2023-09-23, 12:12:55 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Dubs specialists are less known than someone like Rublev. Won't pack a stadium
[2023-09-23, 12:13:24 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Rublev is also a legit dubs player. He won Gold at the Olympics and has won a M1000
[2023-09-23, 12:16:30 AM] Santiago: Reach out in the AM if you decide to go tomorrow Adrian
[2023-09-23, 12:43:02 AM] Shardul Bansal: Avi how’s about an 8:45 start? I really neeeeed the sleep man 👀😬
[2023-09-23, 12:43:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: I doubt we’ll get kicked off with the weather lookin so bad
[2023-09-23, 12:46:04 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Sure
[2023-09-23, 7:35:33 AM] Santiago: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-09-23, 8:18:08 AM] Shardul Bansal: Fuckkkkk GENTS it’s raining
[2023-09-23, 8:19:34 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Happy with my life choices. I'm still in bed. It's dry in Burnaby. 😂.
[2023-09-23, 8:22:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea that might’ve been the smart move, my weather apps never get the timing of when it’s gonna rain correct
[2023-09-23, 8:23:58 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: But also in the other direction. Rain might not have started until after.
[2023-09-23, 8:24:07 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think it is now run day
‎[2023-09-23, 9:15:17 AM] Santiago: ‎image omitted
[2023-09-23, 9:33:16 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I love staring at the 100s of empty seats that cost 500+$ a piece and so they were not filled
[2023-09-23, 9:40:12 AM] Santiago: Honestky, the event was decent… but the seats were overall toooo expensive. IMO
[2023-09-23, 9:40:55 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: For a one time event paying 80$ for 4 hours of quality entertainment isn't so bad in my mind
[2023-09-23, 9:41:52 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: My fav tennis event I've gone to is still just the Van open. Cheap tickets for a whole day of matches where you're sitting immediately court side is just amazing
[2023-09-23, 9:44:16 AM] Santiago: Bruh, we paid 130 each
[2023-09-23, 9:44:24 AM] Santiago: The van open is lit
[2023-09-23, 9:44:40 AM] Santiago: And for mediocre seats
[2023-09-23, 9:45:12 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ours were definitely under 100
[2023-09-23, 10:46:35 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Is van open happening next year
[2023-09-23, 11:24:22 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: No clueee. They're renovating the stadium court I think. I'm hoping it's because they want the capacity for a 250
[2023-09-23, 12:38:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://youtu.be/LLq8bFIAf8A?si=vAmSJT5LbmgOt7p_
[2023-09-23, 12:39:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: So the issue with Gael Felix was a time violation that Felix brought to the attention of the chair umpire, Gael didn’t like it which is why he “hurried” his play in the final game in the first set
[2023-09-23, 12:39:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: That was bizarre because it looked like such an even match up, but looks like we missed some on court commentary 😬
[2023-09-23, 12:40:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It was neck and neck until 4-5
[2023-09-23, 12:40:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Super weird. Monfils just kinda throwing in the Towel
[2023-09-23, 12:47:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4utFaSYuKzA`
[2023-09-23, 12:48:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: These guys were just chillin on Thursday eve at the Vancouver Convention Center 😭, could've definitely seen em out and about
[2023-09-23, 12:48:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also spotted Bill Gates?!!
[2023-09-23, 12:48:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Need to slide into Andre's DM's and see if he wants to hit a ball

[2023-09-23, 12:52:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: The thing is, there's definitely going to be a closing night gala, I'm tryna figure out where
[2023-09-23, 12:52:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: going full stalking mode for this rn
[2023-09-23, 12:53:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Lmk if you find it 😂. I'm not above stalking Federer
[2023-09-25, 10:12:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: I did not find it because they didn’t do a closing night gala 🙃
[2023-09-25, 10:13:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ve got a court booked for SP at 9:30 to 10:30 for Saturday, I say we hit it up at 8:30 AM and play for a couple hours? Who’s in? I reckon we can book a couple courts if we’re all down!
[2023-09-25, 10:14:28 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I might be keen, I just need to sort out plans with another friend first.
[2023-09-25, 10:14:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Otherwise did we want to book a court for Wednesday or Thursday morning?
[2023-09-25, 10:18:53 PM] Shardul Bansal: Out at Richmond? I could be down for Thursday morning yea
[2023-09-25, 10:19:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Works for me!
[2023-09-25, 10:53:09 PM] Santiago: I’ll prob tag along for the Saturday tennis. Not sure about the Thursday. How you all get there?

[2023-09-26, 8:45:05 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Fuck can’t do Friday morning
[2023-09-26, 9:06:20 PM] Santiago: https://x.com/rainmaker1973/status/1706637450842370106?s=48&t=wjHNSiBvgq6yGe56H5IWKQ
[2023-09-26, 9:06:41 PM] Santiago: @16472039624 before every serve. Wait for the end 😂

[2023-09-27, 8:58:26 PM] Santiago: They were calling for sun tomorrow PM 😢. Not sure if I’ll be able to make the trek out to Richmond
[2023-09-27, 8:58:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If Shardul is taking a mobi why not just carpool?
[2023-09-27, 9:03:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea Santiago I can just pick you up on the way with the modo
[2023-09-27, 9:07:13 PM] Santiago: You sure? Feels a bit out of the way 😊

[2023-09-29, 12:11:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: But also, tomorrow might be completely dry, so we could just do false Creek?
[2023-09-29, 1:35:10 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Can’t make it broski
[2023-09-29, 1:35:28 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Dude you booked the court

[2023-09-29, 6:01:12 AM] Shardul Bansal: I mean at least we won’t have to sit in traffic coming back, let’s do that
[2023-09-29, 6:01:37 AM] Santiago: False creek?
[2023-09-29, 6:02:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Fine by me. I'll be a bit later than 6:45 though. Woke up planning on being at Richmond for 7 and it's faster for me

[2023-09-29, 6:47:30 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, I’ll be there 5 past 7!
[2023-09-30, 8:23:53 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: @16472039624 did you still end up paying for that court?
[2023-09-30, 8:26:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: Indeeed! Come thru today, got the court 2 from 9:30 onwards but hoping to be there earlier, like quarter to!
[2023-09-30, 8:27:22 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The one yesterday we chose to not go to I meant 😛.
[2023-09-30, 8:28:10 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I've got a bit too much stuff going on today so I cannot join unfortunately.
[2023-09-30, 8:41:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: oh, yea, couldn’t cancel, tennis BC hub at Richmond doesn’t allow it 😔
[2023-09-30, 8:44:10 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Irritating. But all good. Sent my share of the court fee

[2023-10-01, 7:26:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I don't ride bike that much. The fitness is very different.
[2023-10-01, 7:26:56 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What made you decide to go to Port Moody?
[2023-10-01, 8:11:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Kevin from the lab goes that route often. It was really nice
[2023-10-01, 8:11:24 PM] Avi Mehrotra: We have to go there soon
[2023-10-01, 8:11:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Before the depressing weather becomes a more regular affair

[2023-10-11, 10:12:08 PM] Avi Mehrotra: If your hitting partner tomorrow is good, recruit him lol
[2023-10-11, 10:12:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: let’s find out, he kicked ass in the ubc singles league but that was so long ago 🤷‍♂️
[2023-10-11, 10:20:15 PM] Santiago: Yeh, he solid player. would be good substitute for papi shardul next month 👀
[2023-10-11, 10:24:10 PM] Santiago: As long as it’s not 715+++, all good. I’ll be there for 7 🫡. See you all 🛌
[2023-10-12, 6:42:28 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Are you still going to be there at 7? Coz sunrise is at 7:30

[2023-10-14, 2:19:18 PM] Santiago: I would be down for an Afternoon/evening on a weekday
[2023-10-14, 2:19:27 PM] Santiago: Also, end of next week supposed to be sunny 🌞

[2023-12-16, 9:10:37 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also 10am?
[2023-12-16, 9:49:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I can’t play in the morning, unfortunately. Only in the evening-ish.
[2023-12-16, 9:49:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Can we play at the courts with the lights
[2023-12-16, 9:49:42 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Where me you and Brian hit that one time?
[2023-12-16, 11:35:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yup!
[2023-12-16, 11:35:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What time?
[2023-12-16, 11:49:35 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Around 6?
[2023-12-16, 11:56:53 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do it

[2023-12-17, 9:04:10 AM] Santiago: When you back bruh?

@16047827064 these are the courts if you'd forgotten
[2023-12-17, 5:04:49 PM] Santiago: @17788869646, any interest in playing next Saturday 11-1pm Richmond? Avi and I got a court
[2023-12-17, 5:05:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I have another family Christmas lunch thing then. 

I also might skip and come to tennis after yesterdays other Christmas lunch 🙃
[2023-12-17, 5:07:38 PM] Santiago: You are always welcome! The court time is locked in 🫡🫡🫡
[2023-12-22, 10:17:52 AM] Santiago: Reminder about tomorrow 11am gents @16047827064. You coming out @17788869646?

[2023-12-22, 10:41:26 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: You were tossing it like 2.5 times your height 😂

[2023-12-22, 10:41:54 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: There's a range. I personally find it easier to hit at the apex.
[2023-12-22, 10:42:08 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also this looks awesome
[2023-12-22, 10:42:11 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Super jealous
[2023-12-22, 10:43:48 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ayush has a similar toss to your old one I noticed

[2023-12-22, 10:51:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea you’re right that’s a stupid high toss
[2023-12-22, 10:52:00 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: A bit of a drop is okay, you just shouldn't be stopping mid motion to aim. Should be a smooth throwing motion.
[2023-12-22, 10:52:08 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: And your serve is scary now
[2023-12-22, 10:52:25 AM] Shardul Bansal: it’s back to being scary shit, havent served in so long
[2023-12-22, 10:53:17 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: First few sessions will suck but it'll come back pretty quick
[2023-12-22, 10:55:25 AM] Shardul Bansal: Aayush film your toss and send it here
[2023-12-22, 11:39:21 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Oui oui
[2023-12-22, 11:42:08 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Don’t worry fam, we haven’t played much in your absence. You won’t find a skill differential
[2023-12-22, 11:42:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I've been getting out like once every 10 days basically
[2023-12-22, 11:42:45 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Same
[2023-12-22, 11:43:22 AM] Avi Mehrotra: @12368699804 has been ripping it consistently. He’ll own you @16472039624
[2023-12-22, 5:02:11 PM] Santiago: Btw - we gotta plan a tennis + all-you-can-eat bennys + hot tub session to hear what coach @16472039624has been up to
‎[2023-12-22, 9:24:27 PM] Aayush: ‎video omitted
[2023-12-22, 9:25:43 PM] Aayush: @16472039624 Adrian filmed this the other day, it’s pretty high as well
[2023-12-22, 9:25:53 PM] Aayush: been trying to change that now tho
[2023-12-22, 9:30:48 PM] Santiago: good whack tho!
[2023-12-22, 9:36:54 PM] Aayush: yeah this one went fine but tbh it was kinda a shank, idk if its apparent in the clip
[2023-12-22, 9:37:12 PM] Aayush: i hit it at the top bit of my racket
[2023-12-22, 9:37:24 PM] Aayush: mistimed most likely
[2023-12-22, 11:43:30 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Okay a bit of analysis from me: the issue is not the fact that your toss is too high. The issue is that you’re not loading - bending your knees to launch yourself up and forward.
[2023-12-22, 11:45:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Rather, you’re not loading long enough nor far down enough. Right now, your toss is quite high, but both of you tend to lean into your serves rather than launch into them. That means that your momentum is already moving forward as you’re waiting on the ball to drop.
[2023-12-22, 11:46:04 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Does that make sense
[2023-12-23, 12:01:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: From that serve I believe it, holy shit eh Aayush
[2023-12-23, 12:03:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: I see what you mean Avi, i hit the ball only a couple inches off the ground, but if I were to actually launch myself, I’d probably be able to hit the ball with my feet at least half a foot above the ground
[2023-12-23, 12:05:56 AM] Shardul Bansal: Avi you do that quite well
[2023-12-23, 12:08:38 AM] Shardul Bansal: Soooo excited, let’s book a time in early Jan!
[2023-12-23, 12:10:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: I think the toss being too high is also an issue, I’m not able to get a consistent toss since I toss it so high, which affects what my body will do to in order to adjust to the toss. Since I’ve started tossing lower, I can also predictably move my body better before hitting the ball
[2023-12-23, 12:39:45 AM] Aayush: let’s see if i can keep that up through my trip to india
[2023-12-23, 12:40:24 AM] Aayush: the way i’ve been eating looks like i’ll be too slow to rip anything in jan
[2023-12-23, 1:17:04 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Ehhh don’t sweat it. Enjoy home cooked food while you can.
[2023-12-23, 8:26:14 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also the higher the toss, the faster it's moving when you hit it, the harder it is to time. It's similar to how it's easier to hit and overhead after it's bounced.
[2023-12-23, 2:46:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Adding another player to the list who will own @16472039624 lmao. Good ol’ Santiago. Absolutely obliterated me today. Man’s playing legendary tennis.
[2023-12-23, 3:16:36 PM] Santiago: Might have practiced on the ball machine recently 👀

[2024-01-05, 9:11:38 AM] Santiago: Any interest in next Saturday 8-10pm Richmond @16472039624 @17788869646 ? Else we gotta fight tooth and nail for ubc court time
[2024-01-05, 9:11:47 AM] Santiago: You away , right senor @16047827064?
[2024-01-05, 9:13:20 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I might be busy that day. If you book a court to play with Shardul I'll see if I can join but I cannot confirm yet

[2024-01-05, 3:26:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Gonna be making some big changes in my life so I’ll be much more flexible with my time
[2024-01-05, 3:27:47 PM] Santiago: 🔥🔥🔥
[2024-01-05, 3:28:01 PM] Santiago: Faaackk!!! Looking forward to hearing about it 🍆

[2024-01-05, 11:41:28 PM] Aayush: that’s great to hear @16472039624 now u can join Avi and i on our noon discount hour hits during the week
[2024-01-06, 8:38:43 AM] Santiago: Shit! No bookings at Richmond next Saturday 😢. Will have to aim for ubc. Maybe @16047827064 or @17788869646 can aim for the discounted rate 👀
[2024-01-06, 9:08:29 AM] Santiago: Or a morning slot + catch-up brunch 👀. TBD gents ❤️
[2024-01-06, 9:33:08 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can probably do morning tennis next weekend

[2024-01-10, 4:52:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I don't think I'll be free to book at 10am Friday. So maybe you book? I'm still a coin toss if I can join
[2024-01-10, 4:53:44 PM] Santiago: Would Sunday work better?
[2024-01-10, 4:54:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: No Saturday probably best. I'll try to get a more firm answer by tomorrow

[2024-01-10, 4:58:56 PM] Santiago: He is pretty much AO ready based on how our last match went ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-10, 5:06:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I zoned and played probably the highest level I have ever played. Santiago was the unfortunate recipient.
[2024-01-10, 5:07:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I should probably be good to join for saturday morning though. Hopefully we can start to get the whole crew back together

[2024-01-15, 10:30:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Will see what the updated forecast is tomorrow
[2024-01-17, 1:55:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: anyone up for an early morning hit tomorrow at richmond from 6:30 to 8?
[2024-01-17, 1:57:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: granted we can get there and back 🤷‍♂️
[2024-01-17, 2:13:32 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Already playing 😔
[2024-01-17, 2:14:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If you're desperate I could ask Hussein if he's chill with you joining us in Surrey 9-10:30?
[2024-01-17, 3:43:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: dang, how far is that? Might be some ways away for me
[2024-01-17, 3:43:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Surrey tennis center
[2024-01-17, 3:44:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTfh9FNHNtsTrHRV9
[2024-01-17, 3:44:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: nah, y’all play, 2 is so much better than 3, dont think its worth for me, might be around 2 hours of commuting there and back
[2024-01-17, 3:45:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds good. Just want you to actually have a chance to demo some sticks
[2024-01-17, 3:45:15 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think swapping might be better as a spring project lol
[2024-01-17, 3:45:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: Imma ask to extend cus ubc closed down for tomorrow as well, so no tennis out there for us, maybe if someone’s up for a Friday day-hit
[2024-01-17, 3:51:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think I'm shackled up for the day with work and non-tennis social obligations at night
[2024-01-17, 4:01:39 PM] Aayush: i’m down for friday
[2024-01-18, 8:50:34 AM] Santiago: Anyone down for a Saturday PM or Sunday AM hit at ubc?

[2024-01-18, 9:48:30 AM] Santiago: Prob not safe to be running in this weather @17788869646. Tennis prob the best choice 👀. The rest of you back?
[2024-01-18, 9:49:14 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Last week we played on a court with a pond at the back
[2024-01-18, 9:49:26 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can probably join tho
[2024-01-18, 1:22:12 PM] Santiago: Nahhh, that was just part of last weeks drills. Nothing to worry about, good sir
[2024-01-18, 1:22:55 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I never want to leave my comfort of 2 meters behind the baseline again
[2024-01-18, 1:24:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yes
[2024-01-18, 1:24:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh damn

[2024-01-20, 10:49:50 AM] Santiago: @17788869646 @16472039624, bad news, ubc didn’t refund the court 😔. We at $26 each.
[2024-01-20, 10:50:36 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Happy to pay my share. You should 100% go complain to them though. They said they'd refund it/give you credit.
[2024-01-20, 10:51:53 AM] Santiago: Ok let me inquire today. We have zero leverage and they know that. We’ll keep going back even if they fuck us over
[2024-01-20, 10:52:50 AM] Santiago: Ill follow up tonight

[2024-01-20, 12:25:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Google reviews are surprisingly effective with these people. I wrote one on the sorry state of the bubble and they washed the courts within the week.
[2024-01-20, 12:25:44 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So you never know
[2024-01-20, 3:52:07 PM] Santiago: 8-10am next sun(28th) Richmond? Tennis and Bennys

[2024-01-30, 12:03:07 PM] Santiago: Dang! Ball machine on steroids
[2024-01-30, 3:12:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can maybe join for Saturday. I'll need to touch base with Alexis first though. She gets priority over me after being gone for a week 😛
[2024-01-31, 4:51:54 PM] Santiago: @12368699804 @16047827064, you guys coming out Friday night? Looking for them discount rate

[2024-01-31, 5:18:28 PM] Santiago: Anyone down for Friday eve? @12368699804 ?
[2024-01-31, 5:22:02 PM] Santiago: Could prob swing Sunday if Friday doesn’t pan out
[2024-01-31, 5:24:05 PM] Aayush: i can do 1 hour friday evening
[2024-01-31, 5:24:32 PM] Aayush: maybe more like night depending on court availability
[2024-01-31, 5:50:34 PM] Santiago: Maybe push it to the Sunday then 😂
[2024-01-31, 6:00:44 PM] Aayush: idk i haven’t been able to get a court on sunday in ages
[2024-01-31, 6:01:43 PM] Aayush: why has getting courts become such a pain lately 😡
[2024-01-31, 6:02:00 PM] Aayush: might be better off trying for friday 1 hr imo
[2024-01-31, 7:45:25 PM] Santiago: Aight let’s do it. If you get 2, we could play a set(s) 👀
[2024-01-31, 7:49:49 PM] Aayush: i’m sorry man 2 seems hard to do
[2024-01-31, 7:50:00 PM] Aayush: well it mostly depends on the hours we’re getting
[2024-01-31, 7:51:50 PM] Aayush: i’ll text u tomorrow depending upon what we can potentially get and then we can decide
[2024-01-31, 7:59:37 PM] Santiago: 👍🏽
[2024-02-03, 6:05:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: Anyone wanna hit outside tomorrow during the day?
[2024-02-03, 6:06:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, the weather might permit it
[2024-02-03, 6:15:35 PM] Aayush: ye
[2024-02-03, 6:15:49 PM] Aayush: avi and i were planning on it
[2024-02-03, 6:16:21 PM] Aayush: but what happened to “i need rest for a couple of days” bro??
[2024-02-03, 6:18:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: i rested for a couple days
[2024-02-03, 6:19:48 PM] Aayush: oh u didn’t play friday?
[2024-02-03, 6:30:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: Nah, couldnt secure a court
[2024-02-03, 6:31:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: but if theres a fourth or even a fifth down to join @17788869646/@16138999983 let’s do a nice big group hit 🤩 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-03, 6:44:37 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do it 👍
[2024-02-03, 6:46:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I have not hit in 3 weeks though. I might steal one of you who hits like a ball machine/wall (@16138999983 ) for the first hour to just get my rhythm though
[2024-02-03, 6:48:19 PM] Santiago: Aight! I’m a whore for Stanley park/False C, but flexible. Will let  @17788869646 decide 🫡 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-03, 6:48:53 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: QE? I think it'll be the driest
[2024-02-03, 7:43:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: fuck yeaaaa, let’s do it, Avi and Aayush, where were you folks planning on playing?
[2024-02-03, 7:44:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: and what time?
[2024-02-03, 7:44:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: id like my sleep tonight 😌
[2024-02-03, 7:45:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 6:30am, no ones preventing you from going to bed now 😚
[2024-02-03, 7:46:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Actually though I was thinking 9:30?
[2024-02-03, 7:46:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: well we’ll just wear headlights eh
[2024-02-03, 7:47:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Headlamp tennis
[2024-02-03, 7:47:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Seems fine
[2024-02-03, 7:47:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: mec was doing a warehouse sale out at surrey today, should’ve copped a dozen
[2024-02-03, 8:06:39 PM] Aayush: man i was thinking more like afternoon, have to be up late today doing assignments and stuff
[2024-02-03, 9:19:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: When can you play? I'd still prefer morning but I'm somewhat flexible
[2024-02-03, 9:35:19 PM] Aayush: honestly u guys go ahead don’t base ur plan around me
[2024-02-03, 9:35:24 PM] Aayush: i’ll make it if i can
[2024-02-03, 9:36:38 PM] Aayush: i gotta collect my racket tomorrow too
[2024-02-03, 9:36:48 PM] Aayush: from r and r
[2024-02-03, 9:37:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If we pushed it forward to 10:30 would that work?
[2024-02-03, 9:38:45 PM] Aayush: likely yes but it depends on what time i get to sleep tonight
[2024-02-03, 9:39:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What's your homework, if it's physics I can do it 😂
[2024-02-03, 9:39:41 PM] Aayush: so if 10:30 is inconvenient, then probably don’t bother
[2024-02-03, 9:39:57 PM] Aayush: it’s software stuff 🥲
[2024-02-03, 9:40:05 PM] Aayush: but thanks
[2024-02-03, 9:41:15 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: @16472039624 @16138999983 want to meet at 10 tomorrow then? Give Aayush a little more time. 

If you show up late I don't mind stepping aside and warming you up. My goal tomorrow is to just hit 10000 balls pretty much
[2024-02-03, 9:41:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: My software skills are fairly limited to image processing or just anything Matlab sadly.
[2024-02-03, 9:44:17 PM] Aayush: yeah i can try for that, no promises tho
[2024-02-03, 9:44:23 PM] Aayush: i’ll make it if i can
[2024-02-03, 9:44:32 PM] Aayush: where btw?

[2024-02-04, 8:40:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: LOTR are like must sees regardless based on just how good they are.

[2024-02-04, 3:49:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 3.5 hours of tennis seems to have mystically healed my leg injury lmao. I don't understand. This is the first time In weeks it hasn't hurt.

[2024-02-04, 4:01:50 PM] Aayush: thanks man!

[2024-02-04, 5:27:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Usually i feel better the next day unless it's an injury 😛
[2024-02-04, 5:28:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Or do like a proper hard effort. But we'll see. It is an injury in this case

[2024-02-04, 11:09:56 PM] Aayush: that’s interesting. that’s what i do mostly as well. i feel like it’s hard to hit a very good down the line backhand even if the opponent guesses that i’ll hit cross
[2024-02-04, 11:10:44 PM] Aayush: ofc this doesn’t work on @16472039624
[2024-02-05, 8:10:39 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Simply never approach the net 🤷
[2024-02-05, 9:39:09 AM] Avi Mehrotra: You can overcompensate with Shardul lol and assume he’ll hit the down the line forehand LOL
[2024-02-05, 7:14:37 PM] Santiago: On my way
[2024-02-05, 7:14:52 PM] Santiago: Should be at the usual spot by 730 @16047827064

[2024-02-09, 2:51:42 PM] Aayush: yep let’s do it
[2024-02-09, 10:44:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: anyone else interested in joining?

[2024-02-19, 6:16:27 PM] Santiago: Celebrating that it finally worked 😂
[2024-02-19, 6:30:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: oooooh looks sick, pose estimation using openCV?
[2024-02-19, 6:31:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: well done, looks sick
[2024-02-19, 6:37:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is very cool!
[2024-02-19, 6:37:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What is it?
[2024-02-19, 6:39:09 PM] Santiago: OpenPose repo. Took a while to figure out a classic problem: proper CUDA and cmake versions. Basically compatibility issues with libraries
[2024-02-19, 6:41:29 PM] Santiago: The goal is to do it on a 3D reconstruction by having two motion cameras on each post. See if i can generate useful data/measurements from our technique. But truly, just Build for no good reason  🤷🏽‍♂️
[2024-02-19, 6:43:35 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ohh and I guess you could maybe pull data from it? Like swing speed etc?
[2024-02-19, 6:45:01 PM] Santiago: Yeah! Footwork, stance, etc. each “dot” (keypoint) can be pulled for further analysis
[2024-02-19, 6:45:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Very cool. Would love to see that analysis
[2024-02-19, 6:46:34 PM] Santiago: Maybe measure our serve toss, arm angle etc in reference to what it should be. Once again, whether useful or not it’s tbd 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2024-02-19, 6:55:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: this is literally 69% of software engineering
[2024-02-19, 6:56:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: i think it can be super useful, for exactly the reasons you listed!
[2024-02-21, 10:53:35 AM] Santiago: Cheeky Friday night ubc? I think outdoors is bust 👀

[2024-02-23, 6:22:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: 🙋‍♂️
[2024-02-23, 1:07:39 PM] Santiago: @16047827064, I assume no ride for you

[2024-02-25, 9:52:19 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Anyone keen try to try for a UBC court tomorrow night? I'm free after 6. 

Also small chance it clears tonight and is dry for some icy morning tennis.
[2024-02-25, 10:02:31 AM] Shardul Bansal: I don’t know if it’s gonna clear tonight but I could be up for a hit in the evening tomorrow, yea
[2024-02-25, 10:03:57 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do it. I can try to book. Any tips on being the fastest click and winning the court lottery 😂

[2024-02-25, 1:46:02 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Can you try to book too so we have a couple shots?
[2024-02-25, 4:41:04 PM] Santiago: Worst case scenario we get two courts 🤷🏽‍♂️. I can’t book. You booking @16047827064 ?
[2024-02-25, 4:43:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m afk as well
[2024-02-25, 8:04:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I was not fast enough
[2024-02-25, 9:03:49 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Also not fast enough for 9. Need like a quantum computer to get a court smh
[2024-02-25, 9:15:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: sheesh, Tuesday evening?
[2024-02-25, 9:16:02 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah I'm keen. Just gotta gamble until it goes
[2024-02-25, 9:33:09 PM] Aayush: is it supposed to be sunny tomorrow?
[2024-02-25, 9:35:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Kinda yeah
[2024-02-25, 9:35:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Chance of showers in the morning
[2024-02-25, 9:36:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Could you all come out my way? There's a court with good lights in Burnaby we could play at in the evening

[2024-02-26, 2:29:28 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: ☹️
[2024-02-26, 2:32:50 PM] Santiago: Would be down for a hit later in the week/weekend tho
[2024-02-26, 2:34:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Ya, it's just supposed to be raining every other day
[2024-02-26, 2:35:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: ^^^
[2024-02-26, 2:36:36 PM] Santiago: Lil indoor 👀
[2024-02-26, 2:37:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If we can get a court I'm keen, it's just a gamble
[2024-02-26, 2:39:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: ye same
[2024-02-26, 2:43:25 PM] Santiago: are you at vgh @17788869646 ?
[2024-02-26, 2:43:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah
[2024-02-26, 2:44:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: BCCRC technically
[2024-02-28, 11:16:46 AM] Santiago: Anyone down for Friday or Saturday night eve? Looking at lil bleak atm
[2024-02-28, 11:17:13 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: If you can get a court I'm keen.
[2024-02-28, 11:17:38 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Would love a Friday night hit
[2024-02-28, 11:26:51 AM] Santiago: Seems like late AF( 9-11) or early afternoon(2-3pm) 👀
[2024-02-28, 11:27:43 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: UBC is a bit too far for me to go for 1hr of play lol
[2024-02-28, 11:27:46 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can do late
[2024-02-28, 11:27:56 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: On Sat or Sun
[2024-02-28, 11:30:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: Im also down for either, i’m up for a 9-11 pm hit tbh
[2024-02-28, 11:31:35 AM] Aayush: down as well
[2024-02-28, 11:34:31 AM] Santiago: I mean, start time good sir
[2024-02-28, 11:34:56 AM] Santiago: Don’t worry, I won’t pull an @12368699804 on you 👀
[2024-02-28, 11:35:51 AM] Santiago: Aight, seems like we got a tentative dingles crew
[2024-02-28, 11:36:26 AM] Santiago: I’ll see what I can do 🛌. There are options Saturday, so that could be plan B
[2024-02-28, 11:38:40 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can also try to snipe a court Friday night for UBC. Give us more attempts
[2024-02-28, 11:41:36 AM] Santiago: Aight! Worst case scenario we end up with two 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2024-02-29, 11:15:28 AM] Aayush: gents
[2024-02-29, 11:15:59 AM] Aayush: do u want me to try and book tonight as well? @17788869646 and i get cheaper rates i think right?
[2024-02-29, 11:16:25 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: As many shots as possible is best
[2024-02-29, 11:17:37 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yeyeeeee that would be ideal
[2024-02-29, 11:21:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: technically, court 12 is available for 1hr from 8-9 and court 2,3,4 and 8 are available for 2 hours from 9-11. We can still play 8-10 pm but just switch courts in the middle of the hour
[2024-02-29, 11:21:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: and...if we wanna continue playing longer, we can just hit from 10-11 as well, I seriously doubt anyone will book that hour
[2024-02-29, 11:25:36 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah we can try that
[2024-02-29, 11:25:52 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think we can each only make one booking though.
[2024-02-29, 1:44:54 PM] Santiago: I’m down to try that. We can all try for the 8-9 and then the remaining ppl can go for the 9-10?
[2024-02-29, 1:47:07 PM] Aayush: if the court isn’t already booked by then, yeah
[2024-02-29, 1:53:27 PM] Santiago: 👍🏽
[2024-02-29, 8:00:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: ok the 8 o clock court was already booked
[2024-02-29, 8:00:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: so 9-11 it is gents
[2024-02-29, 8:01:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: i feel poor
[2024-02-29, 8:01:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: should we just get the ace pass next season and split it
[2024-02-29, 8:03:03 PM] Aayush: lol not a bad idea at all
[2024-02-29, 8:03:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea, I can buy it and share the credentials with y'all. We have to phone to book, but we can all pretend to be me
[2024-02-29, 8:03:43 PM] Aayush: buy it on avi or adrian’s account so we can avail student discounts
[2024-02-29, 8:03:51 PM] Aayush: or even mine for this year
[2024-02-29, 8:03:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: word
[2024-02-29, 8:04:31 PM] Aayush: ok i’ll try booking at 9
[2024-02-29, 8:05:14 PM] Aayush: hopefully there won’t be much of a contest for that slot
[2024-02-29, 8:42:13 PM] Santiago: Yeh, def getting it next year
[2024-02-29, 8:42:33 PM] Santiago: Where you booking? I can try another or same
[2024-02-29, 8:44:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll try for 3
[2024-02-29, 8:46:27 PM] Aayush: main centre prices are relatively the same student or non i think right?
[2024-02-29, 8:46:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think so, but 🤷
[2024-02-29, 8:47:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I only see 2,3 and 8 open
[2024-02-29, 8:49:22 PM] Aayush: ok i’ll be on 2 then
[2024-02-29, 9:01:04 PM] Santiago: Dang any luck?
[2024-02-29, 9:02:03 PM] Aayush: not on my end

[2024-02-29, 9:04:45 PM] Aayush: even both
[2024-02-29, 9:04:59 PM] Santiago: I’m down for Saturday
[2024-02-29, 9:05:12 PM] Santiago: Sundays are bleak in terms of bookings
[2024-02-29, 9:05:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can maybe do tomorrow
[2024-02-29, 9:05:50 PM] Santiago: On a separate note, I could get a court for next Friday at Richmond hub. Any interest?
[2024-02-29, 9:06:14 PM] Santiago: You mean saturday?
[2024-02-29, 9:06:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Grab it
[2024-02-29, 9:07:31 PM] Aayush: can’t commit yet, but possibly. what time?
[2024-02-29, 9:08:40 PM] Santiago: Seems like plenty of courts Saturday after 5/6. Down to try for that
[2024-02-29, 9:08:46 PM] Santiago: After 7
[2024-02-29, 9:09:32 PM] Aayush: @17788869646 can u do this time?
[2024-02-29, 9:10:24 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Yeah I can
[2024-02-29, 9:11:16 PM] Aayush: ok then let’s aim for this slot
[2024-02-29, 9:11:41 PM] Aayush: sometime between 5 pm and 11 pm saturday
[2024-02-29, 9:11:46 PM] Aayush: the earlier the better
[2024-02-29, 9:11:54 PM] Aayush: any objections
[2024-02-29, 9:11:59 PM] Aayush: ?
[2024-02-29, 9:12:29 PM] Santiago: Nope 🫡
[2024-02-29, 9:12:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do it.

[2024-03-01, 5:03:30 PM] Aayush: in spite of some fast clicking i couldn’t get the bubble courts 5-7

[2024-03-30, 10:12:27 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Same one as before I think, but it flared up differently. Tendon is just hurting. Going to go see a physio this week I think. It's very frustrating. 

I think it's in a: maybe fine now but if you test it, it will be really not fine, state. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-30, 10:12:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: What exactly happened

[2024-03-30, 10:15:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Calf tendon. 

Tried a new set of shoes in January, they disagreed with me a lot. Kinda been trying to train through it at 50% to keep my fitness. I was feeling at 90% two weeks ago and got excited and flared it up again.
[2024-03-30, 10:22:42 PM] Santiago: Oooof tough to hear that it got worse 😔! Obv super welcome to come out tomorrow if you feel better. Otherwise, take it easy good sir 🫡. Physio is a good idea. Like I mentioned, it has been a pretty good experience for me.
[2024-03-30, 10:24:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Im going to rest it tomorrow even if it feels good. We've made this mistake before 😂

[2024-03-30, 10:33:23 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I might wake up and hit some serves on my own, but I should definitely not be running
[2024-03-30, 10:44:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It’s okay you can hit volleys
[2024-03-30, 10:44:22 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And we can do target practice

[2024-04-10, 8:23:45 PM] Santiago: Orrrr! We could book at SP for say 11am? $12 per person 👀 for two hours. Lock down 2 courts
[2024-04-10, 8:24:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The 99 never stops, False Creek will probably be less crazy?

[2024-04-10, 8:24:35 PM] Aayush: or this

[2024-04-10, 8:26:23 PM] Santiago: I like I like! I would rather book, as I’ll be playing late the night before. Let me confirm with Josh

[2024-05-10, 7:55:28 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Melatonin worked too well.
[2024-05-10, 7:55:31 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Fuck me
[2024-05-10, 9:28:29 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Your Garmin will be patting you on the back for a good sleep
[2024-05-20, 1:24:07 PM] Santiago: Looking for a 4th. False creek Thursday 7am
[2024-06-01, 12:14:10 PM] Santiago: When you back coach @16472039624
[2024-06-01, 12:23:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: The respect you put on my name is completely unjustified ahaha i love it Santiago ❤️
[2024-06-01, 12:24:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll be in Vancouver sometime later this month, don’t know when specifically!
[2024-06-01, 3:27:47 PM] Santiago: I have yet to beat you, so “coach” until then 🫡
[2024-06-01, 3:28:51 PM] Santiago: Looking forward to the hot AF hit sesh at SP 🌞🎾 ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-06-11, 9:16:00 AM] Shardul Bansal: Lower toss doing it for him eh
[2024-06-11, 9:19:30 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Feels pretty direct to me.
[2024-06-11, 9:23:51 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's just so much easier to time. 74% first serves when he's hitting them at like 134mph on average.
[2024-06-11, 7:49:36 PM] Santiago: I also feel like the longer the  ball stays in air, the more vulnerable it becomes to environmental factors and minor deviations in the toss ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-06-11, 7:51:07 PM] Santiago: I found these stats super interesting: the goats win ~80% of matches, but only ~55% of points
[2024-06-11, 9:37:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's overall just making your life harder
[2024-06-11, 9:38:21 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This makes sense. Tennis is about being better in the margins.
[2024-06-11, 10:42:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: @16138999983 see u in Burnaby 4.5!!!!

[2024-06-11, 11:06:19 PM] Aayush: @17788869646 starts 20th june. ur not playing?
[2024-06-11, 11:07:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Probably not, thesis is due to my external on the 24th. So I can guarantee I'm free at all.
[2024-06-11, 11:08:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: But I live like 10 minutes away, so if I'm free I'll head over for a bit to watch you all

[2024-06-19, 6:43:01 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Opposite for me
[2024-06-19, 6:48:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: No you're more like me and hit too low sometimes
[2024-06-19, 9:45:20 PM] Aayush: folks i don’t think tmrw’s gonna happen for me, i wanna have a full nights rest for my match
[2024-06-19, 9:45:39 PM] Aayush: but hope to see you guys at the open at some point!

[2024-08-26, 10:08:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm trying to get together a small group to have a hit Sunday morning. So far it's me Santi and Leo. Anyone around to join?
[2024-08-26, 10:16:56 PM] Aayush: what time are we thinking?
[2024-08-26, 10:17:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 9:30, false creek
[2024-08-26, 10:17:49 PM] Aayush: i can make that if you need a fourth
[2024-08-26, 10:18:11 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Eh, kinda just getting a group. Hopefully we snap up two courts.
[2024-08-26, 10:18:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The more the merrier
[2024-08-26, 10:18:26 PM] Aayush: ok cool i’m in then!
[2024-08-26, 10:18:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Awesome!
[2024-08-26, 10:19:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Neither of you have hit with Leo, he's got a unique ball. You'll have fun 😂
[2024-08-26, 10:19:56 PM] Aayush: oh interesting, i hope it’s not weirdly spinning balls
[2024-08-26, 10:19:58 PM] Aayush: lol
[2024-08-26, 10:21:23 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Not in the slightest. It's just endless full power knuckle balls
[2024-08-26, 10:46:47 PM] Aayush: wow ok
[2024-08-26, 10:47:35 PM] Aayush: can’t wait to see that

[2024-08-31, 8:25:06 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yessirrr
[2024-08-31, 8:26:59 PM] Avi Mehrotra: If it weren’t Sunday tomorrow, we could go to the prototype coffee that’s opened a few blocks away after tennis!
[2024-08-31, 8:27:40 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh dang. Next time!

I was thinking we do Modus after.
[2024-08-31, 8:28:02 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Just as good 😊
[2024-08-31, 8:28:44 PM] Aayush: honestly it would be great if we could grab a bite to eat after
[2024-08-31, 8:28:59 PM] Aayush: i’m always hungry after a session
[2024-08-31, 8:31:36 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's another option. We could grab some takeout and I could key us into my work which is a block away. There's a bike locker + the 15th floor has a nice view.
[2024-08-31, 9:13:04 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Really depends on time for me. I have to be back by 12:45 to 1
[2024-08-31, 9:13:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Modus also has food 🤷. Well figure it out
[2024-08-31, 9:45:28 PM] Santiago: Modus has pretty decent food
[2024-09-01, 9:19:18 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll be ~5-10 late. The busses are fickle this morning

[2024-09-01, 9:20:37 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I should have stayed on the train to DT. Been just vibing at commercial for 10 mins
[2024-09-01, 5:31:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: @16047827064 could you add Vijay to the group? He said he'd be working in Van part time and might join us for early tennis

[2024-09-03, 9:46:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I spent a lot of time in Hawaii when I was younger, and the locals always say that you should never turn your back to the ocean.
[2024-09-03, 10:05:33 PM] Santiago: Daaang!!! This is crazy. Glad to hear you’re alright sir. Can’t say it looked like a good idea from the beginning 😂

[2024-09-07, 9:07:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: lol no I have to help out with 300 chores and favors I promised her I’d do and forgot about

[2024-09-27, 11:34:00 PM] Aayush: i think i’ll be the first one to play with her since i play at ubc basically everyday, unless u guys can schedule smth for fc first
[2024-09-27, 11:34:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sure that sounds good 👍
[2024-09-28, 12:36:08 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Y’all have a new friend?
[2024-09-28, 12:36:42 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Can we replace @16472039624 already?
[2024-09-28, 12:37:20 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: We got approached after our hit by some lady from Montreal who said she was about our level. I think she said she played for the Uni team out there. Said she needed hitting partners.
[2024-09-28, 12:37:32 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: If she's decent she can be our friend
[2024-09-28, 12:37:51 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Hahaha love the big IF
[2024-10-01, 3:48:04 PM] Santiago: Gents, coach @17788869646 and I have a court for this Friday in Richmond from 8-10pm. 2 more ppl welcome to join us. Lil dingles 😊
[2024-10-01, 4:40:09 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tempting…
[2024-10-01, 4:40:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Fuck it. Count me in.
[2024-10-01, 4:45:17 PM] Aayush: man i can’t come to this one… a friend’s birthday this friday
[2024-10-01, 5:54:05 PM] ~ Vijay: Im in
[2024-10-01, 7:07:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh baby I'm so ready
[2024-10-01, 7:08:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Gonna absolutely destroy you all at Dingles
[2024-10-01, 7:18:38 PM] ~ Vijay: my spine is dinglin
[2024-10-01, 7:19:10 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh my god 😂
[2024-10-01, 7:45:12 PM] Aayush: major fomo here
[2024-10-01, 8:00:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No.
[2024-10-04, 6:33:22 PM] Santiago: You still coming out @16047827064 ? Could give you a ride. Heading out a bit earlier than usual due to traffic
[2024-10-04, 6:33:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m still at ubc. When do you want me to be at our usual pickup spot?
[2024-10-04, 6:34:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: If I leave now, I can be at home in 30 mins
[2024-10-04, 6:38:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: We're playing at 8 no? It's not going to take 1.5 hours
[2024-10-04, 6:39:36 PM] Santiago: I’ll pick you up at around 715
[2024-10-04, 6:41:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Might have to be 720ish
[2024-10-04, 6:41:38 PM] Santiago: Yeah sure that’s fine. Was thinking shardul pick up time
[2024-10-04, 6:42:56 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Where is that fucker anyway
[2024-10-04, 6:43:08 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Completely abandoned us
[2024-10-04, 6:43:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: @16472039624
[2024-10-04, 6:43:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m not salty at all
[2024-10-04, 11:31:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think that was a super cursed group for dingles. Just 7000 ball rallies every time
[2024-10-04, 11:35:44 PM] Aayush: miss me boys?
[2024-10-04, 11:36:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The composition might have benefited from one more guy who actually likes to attack the net 😂
[2024-10-04, 11:37:15 PM] Aayush: yeah i missed you guys too
[2024-10-04, 11:38:51 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You gotta sub in for me next week
[2024-10-04, 11:38:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Actually no. Vijay was on fucking fire today. He broke my soul.
[2024-10-04, 11:39:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Sorry lol
[2024-10-04, 11:39:40 PM] Aayush: i’ll just replace @16047827064 next time
[2024-10-04, 11:41:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's a little like playing a sponge. I had a really where I hit like 6 bombs in a row and then gave up and started to moon ball lmao
[2024-10-04, 11:42:32 PM] Aayush: dingles do be like that though, attacking never gets me anywhere and i don’t have the patience to keep hitting back neutral balls
[2024-10-04, 11:42:57 PM] Aayush: varying the depth works well i noticed once
[2024-10-04, 11:43:54 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's a game of consistency really. Hard to put the ball away
[2024-10-04, 11:52:56 PM] Aayush: that’s why i feel very liberated when i hear anyone call dingles
[2024-10-05, 12:05:51 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Watching the ball just go cross court over and over again after is a little brutal. I'm just sitting there pretty much begging to have it hit to me
[2024-10-05, 12:28:41 AM] Aayush: this conversation has left me itching for dingles
[2024-10-05, 12:29:04 AM] Aayush: plan something soon and next time i’ll be there
[2024-10-05, 12:29:58 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm out for a week actually. But you should all set something up for next week.
[2024-10-05, 12:35:36 AM] Santiago: Aight gents $17.5 each for today @16047827064 @17788869646 @16043553859 at santiagocampu14@outlook.com
[2024-10-05, 9:14:08 AM] Santiago: The asbesto balls are partly responsible
[2024-10-05, 9:26:57 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I don't get the mindset of feeling the need to play with a ball that makes you have less fun and be worse at tennis 😂
[2024-10-05, 10:00:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: shardul pick up time?? bro i was always on time 🫡
[2024-10-05, 10:01:23 AM] Shardul Bansal: guys ill be back in vancouver for good in jan ❤️❤️❤️
[2024-10-05, 10:01:53 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm going to frame you for a small crime so you can't leave the country again
[2024-10-05, 10:05:24 AM] Shardul Bansal: ahahahaha brilliant
[2024-10-05, 10:10:51 AM] Santiago: I enjoy playing with these and Dunlops. It’s the transitioning back to propenn that sucks
[2024-10-05, 7:27:59 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm gonna bring a set of lacrosse balls to make the transition back to propenns a dream
[2024-10-12, 10:28:52 AM] Santiago: ‎This message was deleted.
[2024-10-24, 8:06:15 PM] Santiago: My buddy Aaron and I got a court tomorrow at ubc 8-10pm. I believe coach @17788869646 is coming out. Anyone else down ? Lil dingles ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-10-24, 10:59:27 PM] ~ Vijay: Iffy, can let ya know tomorrow morning
[2024-10-25, 12:32:48 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I will be there.

@16043553859 hope you can make it. Gotta have more games with the cursed dingles trio.
[2024-10-25, 1:16:28 PM] ~ Vijay: I’ll be there, but can we do some serves at the end?
[2024-10-25, 1:16:47 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I also need to hit serves
[2024-10-25, 1:16:59 PM] ~ Vijay: 2hrs of baselining is ☠️
[2024-10-25, 1:17:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I haven't hit for two weeks, so I would like to do some dingles for just reps. But yeah serving also important
[2024-10-25, 1:18:13 PM] ~ Vijay: Haven’t played much either
[2024-10-25, 2:53:59 PM] Santiago: We can do a couple of doubles games 👀
[2024-10-25, 2:54:15 PM] Santiago: 30min of doubles to cool down 😴 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-10-25, 2:59:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Always fun
[2024-10-25, 2:59:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: If I can hit the box with my serve today
[2024-10-25, 8:10:58 PM] ~ Vijay: Is it in the bubble?
[2024-10-26, 3:58:48 PM] Santiago: Great fun yesterday gents! Thx for coming out. $13 each to me @16043553859 @17788869646 ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-11-16, 8:07:19 PM] Aayush: i wish i could unsee this
[2024-11-16, 8:07:50 PM] Aayush: gents can we plz organize a dingles soon
[2024-11-16, 8:08:21 PM] Aayush: we haven’t played in too long

[2024-11-16, 8:33:48 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Somebody kick this heretic out of the group
[2024-11-16, 9:46:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: ngl i tried this and it was surprisingly fun
[2024-11-16, 9:46:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: but kind of like how table tennis is kinda fun, gets boring fast
[2024-11-16, 9:58:38 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Oh my god stfu
[2024-11-16, 9:58:42 PM] Avi Mehrotra: It’s a plague
[2024-11-16, 9:59:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Ok I read this now
[2024-11-16, 9:59:15 PM] Avi Mehrotra: We good
[2024-11-16, 10:00:15 PM] Aayush: this is what happens when we stop our dingles sessions gents
[2024-11-16, 10:00:31 PM] Aayush: mind wanders to inferior sports
[2024-11-16, 10:16:28 PM] Santiago: Lol! Exactly how I feel about it. Overall low learning curve, so super accessible for ppl unfamiliar with racket sports
‎[2024-11-16, 10:18:03 PM] Santiago: ‎GIF omitted
[2024-11-16, 10:19:17 PM] Santiago: Insane how their indoor courts are as much or more than tennis courts 💸
[2024-11-16, 10:35:17 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Old money pouring in
[2024-11-16, 10:36:19 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Well this is a big thing to attract funding. The sport is easy, it’s social and *fun* for some people without basic motor skills.
[2024-11-16, 10:36:28 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Accessibility is a selling point
[2024-11-22, 9:06:32 PM] Santiago: Coach @12368699804 and I have a court tomorrow at ubc 7-9pm. Who coming out for some dingles? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-11-23, 8:40:58 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCuDAKBoq1R/?igsh=MXYxNHRuMnJrMnV2Nw==

[2024-11-23, 2:27:04 PM] Aayush: let’s do 6
[2024-11-23, 2:27:15 PM] Aayush: 4 hrs is an overkill lmao

[2024-11-23, 10:31:09 PM] Avi Mehrotra: If he’s at the net and the ball is within his reach, the point is over.
[2024-11-23, 10:31:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Happened literally every time today.
[2024-11-23, 10:32:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Let’s do sesh next weekend in the AM, so that we can go to prototype after?

[2024-11-30, 12:07:28 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I have some Artengo's (the harder ones) we could use. The pack of 4 is good for 4 people.
[2024-11-30, 12:16:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I hate you.
[2024-11-30, 12:19:36 PM] Aayush: i’ll be there as well gentlemen
[2024-11-30, 12:19:45 PM] Avi Mehrotra: My legs say thanks

[2024-11-30, 7:07:58 PM] ~ Vijay: Aw man
[2024-11-30, 7:25:16 PM] Santiago: Watched @12368699804 put in work with the girl we met last time 👀
[2024-11-30, 7:26:13 PM] Santiago: $22.5 each @17788869646 @16047827064
[2024-11-30, 8:39:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Missed having you out there.
[2024-11-30, 8:40:09 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Next time. I'm going to try to play a little more for a few weeks here
[2024-12-01, 12:54:04 AM] Aayush: haha lol no we just friends
[2024-12-01, 12:54:06 AM] Aayush: sorta
[2024-12-01, 10:01:20 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: The guy you played looked really strong
[2024-12-01, 11:37:28 AM] Aayush: he’s good i was up 6-4 5-4
[2024-12-01, 11:37:52 AM] Aayush: i was so pissed i couldn’t close the last set 6-3
[2024-12-01, 11:38:01 AM] Aayush: on my serve
[2024-12-01, 11:38:24 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: You looked a little rough on that last game
[2024-12-01, 11:38:41 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like a solid match though
[2024-12-01, 11:38:58 AM] Aayush: yeah i was under pressure haha
[2024-12-01, 11:39:20 AM] Aayush: thinking that if i don’t close this game, i wont win
[2024-12-01, 11:39:26 AM] Aayush: because we were out of time
[2024-12-01, 11:39:32 AM] Aayush: i played rashly
[2024-12-01, 12:06:03 PM] Santiago: Was she watching 👀
[2024-12-01, 12:06:59 PM] Aayush: yes
[2024-12-01, 12:07:22 PM] Aayush: but i play better when girls watch
[2024-12-01, 12:39:27 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Is she a good player? She talked pretty big when she introduced herself
[2024-12-01, 12:42:19 PM] Aayush: she’s great! not our level though
[2024-12-01, 12:42:23 PM] Aayush: i always win
[2024-12-01, 12:42:50 PM] Aayush: but fun to do an easy hit with
[2024-12-01, 12:45:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sweet, cool to see! I'm chill having her join us some time then

I sometimes find the style that more women play to be hard to play against. Everything is so flat and low.
[2024-12-01, 12:45:33 PM] Aayush: yes exactly that is how it is
[2024-12-01, 12:45:57 PM] Aayush: if u guys have a court and wanna play dingles ever
[2024-12-01, 12:46:00 PM] Aayush: but have only 2
[2024-12-01, 12:46:15 PM] Aayush: i can get her to join
[2024-12-01, 12:47:05 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The plan is to play next week some time. But I'd be surprised if we couldn't assemble a full crew
[2024-12-01, 12:47:51 PM] Aayush: ik it would be a crime if we ask her to play and leave @16047827064 out
[2024-12-01, 1:43:16 PM] Santiago: It’s crazy how superior ubc “varsity” tennis(bc tennis in general) is to the rest of Canada  💪🏽
[2024-12-01, 1:43:41 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: SFU's team was fucking stacked when I was there
[2024-12-01, 1:45:01 PM] Santiago: Yeh, so maybe a bc thing. As i understand it, other college players struggle with ubc tryouts
[2024-12-01, 1:45:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think UBC's Varsity team would be competitive at D3 NCAA
[2024-12-01, 1:56:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’d be pissed
[2024-12-01, 1:57:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Like your boys here Aayush and me
[2024-12-01, 1:57:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Got our asses handed to us
[2024-12-01, 2:01:51 PM] Aayush: i got my ass handed to me in round 1 bruh 😭
[2024-12-01, 2:01:57 PM] Aayush: all 4 years
[2024-12-01, 2:02:16 PM] Aayush: i know people who i’ve never lost to ever and they made it to r2
[2024-12-01, 2:03:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You could do grad school, give you more chances 🤡
‎[2024-12-01, 2:04:07 PM] Aayush: ‎image omitted
[2024-12-01, 2:04:18 PM] Aayush: im thinking of doing law school these days
[2024-12-01, 2:04:44 PM] Aayush: but if i watch greys anatomy i might wanna do med school
[2024-12-01, 2:08:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You're comp sci I thought?
[2024-12-01, 2:47:36 PM] Aayush: yep comp eng
[2024-12-01, 2:47:46 PM] Aayush: it’s time for a career change
[2024-12-01, 3:14:48 PM] ~ Vijay: In the rankings as well, BC dominates Canadian rankings
[2024-12-01, 3:19:30 PM] ~ Vijay: Isnt SFU div 2 NCAA? Thought they were similar in level
[2024-12-01, 3:22:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I thought SFU only had their football team being NCAA
[2024-12-01, 6:37:08 PM] ~ Vijay: Is it only football? Thought it was eventually gonna be all sports
[2024-12-01, 6:38:49 PM] ~ Vijay: Havent checked since graduating tho so… 🤷🏽
[2024-12-01, 6:43:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oh, actually I think even the football imploded lmao
[2024-12-01, 6:43:58 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: It was a whole thing last year
[2024-12-01, 6:54:44 PM] ~ Vijay: We sucked from what i remember
[2024-12-01, 6:56:01 PM] ~ Vijay: Also played rec basketball with a few members of the football team and they were absolute boneheads
[2024-12-01, 6:56:12 PM] ~ Vijay: So not surprised at all
[2024-12-01, 7:01:17 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I literally never watched a single game in all the years I was there
[2024-12-01, 7:44:12 PM] ~ Vijay: They made it so hard to even if you wanted to, watched a maybe a quarter each of 2-3 games
[2024-12-05, 9:39:41 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think tomorrow night is the only day I can hit. I'm good for any time at UBC after 6
[2024-12-05, 9:48:30 AM] Santiago: I have an event tomorrow night 😔 and might be going over to the island on Saturday
[2024-12-05, 2:16:59 PM] ~ Vijay: Playing bellingham open tomorrow evening, out this weekend

[2024-12-05, 2:18:29 PM] ~ Vijay: Only up to 4.0 as well
[2024-12-05, 2:18:54 PM] ~ Vijay: You guys should join if you’re free then
[2024-12-05, 2:36:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hmmm
[2024-12-05, 2:36:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Might be fun
[2024-12-12, 8:40:29 PM] ~ Vijay: Any plans to play in the next week or so?
[2024-12-12, 9:31:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Me and Santi were maybe playing Saturday Morning if we can get a court

[2025-01-28, 4:39:49 PM] Santiago: He away I think!
[2025-01-28, 4:41:23 PM] Santiago: Would much rather play a bit later to avoid traffic and having to rush out of work
[2025-01-28, 4:41:43 PM] Santiago: 8-10?
[2025-01-28, 5:14:23 PM] Shardul Bansal: my sleep isn’t optimal when we finish so late + i _might_ be having dinner plans
[2025-01-28, 5:22:02 PM] Aayush: if we’re doing friday might make sense to j book today
[2025-01-28, 5:25:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: yayaya but what time works

[2025-01-28, 5:30:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: imma try for 6-8 but if that doesn’t work, then 7-9
[2025-01-28, 5:30:34 PM] Santiago: I think Bryan Johnson would approve 7-9
[2025-01-28, 5:31:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: wouldn’t get a 100 sleep score with elevated heart rate activity at that hour
[2025-01-28, 5:34:56 PM] Santiago: You forgetting erection count sirrr!

[2025-01-29, 1:13:03 PM] Aayush: what 🫤
[2025-01-29, 1:13:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: i filled out their form last night and this morning they’re like don’t fill out the form because it doesn’t say how long u want the booking for
[2025-01-29, 1:14:29 PM] Aayush: we need to take a look at what slots are available online before we ask them for it, which means that there is no availability for 7-8 on friday
[2025-01-29, 1:14:45 PM] Aayush: this is bs honestly how tf were we supposed to know
[2025-01-29, 1:40:16 PM] Aayush: so are we taking the hour long hit then?
[2025-01-29, 1:44:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: but there was court 7 that was available i checked

[2025-01-29, 5:30:40 PM] Santiago: So we only on for 1hour???
[2025-01-29, 5:31:20 PM] Santiago: I’m gonna spend more time warming up and stretching then actually playing y’all!! 😔
[2025-01-29, 5:35:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: nahhh defo not doing just an hour, calling to figure something else out but if not, gonna cancel
[2025-01-29, 5:36:37 PM] Aayush: cancelling is gonna be a bitch they always make a fish
[2025-01-29, 5:36:40 PM] Aayush: fuss*
[2025-01-29, 5:36:54 PM] Aayush: maybe ace pass holders get better treatment
[2025-01-29, 5:39:56 PM] Santiago: lol what a cludgy ass system jokes lol
[2025-01-29, 5:41:02 PM] Aayush: why can’t we just book like normal on our own on the website 😛
[2025-01-29, 5:41:10 PM] Aayush: but 3 days in advance
[2025-01-29, 6:04:00 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Bro you gotta book courts with these people like you’re communicating with your grandparents. On the phone and very loudly
[2025-01-29, 6:04:49 PM] Avi Mehrotra: No fancy shit like email and quantum tech like webforms.
[2025-01-29, 6:26:03 PM] Aayush: quantum tech 🤣🤣
[2025-01-29, 10:21:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: they said they have availability for 8-10, tryna secure that
[2025-01-29, 10:23:23 PM] Santiago: We’ll take care of the balls as a thank you for dealing with this dial-up powered booking system
[2025-01-29, 10:33:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: I think any of us can just book btw and tell em to charge my card!
[2025-01-29, 10:33:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: so should be easy going forward

[2025-01-30, 7:29:22 AM] Santiago: Should we just eat it and aim for Sunday or we fucked for Sunday too? The fee to lose our ace pass virginity ya know
[2025-01-30, 9:21:14 AM] Aayush: if u just wanna eat it then lemme try to ask a friend if he wants to play and i can take the court instead
[2025-01-30, 9:21:56 AM] Aayush: that is only if we cannot get the court canceled and are not planning to use it either
[2025-01-30, 9:22:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m tryna get 2 hours for Friday, let’s see if we can make that happen first
[2025-01-30, 9:22:25 AM] Shardul Bansal: if we can, i don’t mind showing up at 6 pm
[2025-01-30, 9:23:08 AM] Aayush: ok lmk what the verdict is

[2025-02-12, 7:49:50 PM] Santiago: Cancel culture is dying bruh! We good
[2025-02-12, 7:49:58 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Before y’all start using a ai voice model to clone an Indian accent, remember that they don’t have his voice sample on file lmao
[2025-02-12, 7:50:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So any generic Indian accent will do
[2025-02-12, 7:50:41 PM] Santiago: I’m glad my COD lobby trash talk from teenage days wasn’t recorded
[2025-02-12, 7:51:14 PM] Avi Mehrotra: How many moms did you hypothetically bang the previous night
[2025-02-12, 7:51:29 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: This is how you get elected prime minister

[2025-02-18, 12:00:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I know all about Brian's Johnson
[2025-02-18, 12:32:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I really hope you’re not talking about our mutual friend Brian
[2025-02-18, 12:42:20 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Vampire man
[2025-02-18, 12:58:28 PM] Santiago: Sounds like lots of secrets in the local tennis community. Smacking balls beyond the court 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2025-02-18, 1:01:03 PM] Avi Mehrotra: My B. But for once it wasn’t my sleep cycle. ‘Twas in the doghouse… 🙇

[2025-02-20, 11:48:51 AM] Aayush: oh wow there are no courts available tmrw

[2025-02-20, 12:27:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: saturday hit anyone?
[2025-02-20, 12:29:09 PM] Shardul Bansal: asked to get a court from 4-6 pm saturday
[2025-02-20, 12:29:38 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I could do morning
[2025-02-20, 12:29:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: ya i couldn’t because aayush was using until last night
[2025-02-20, 12:30:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: i could do 8-10 AM

[2025-02-20, 2:36:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Ah man
[2025-02-20, 2:36:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: That sucks
[2025-02-20, 2:42:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: fuckkk i’m sorry to hear that man, how’d u get it
[2025-02-20, 2:42:51 PM] Aayush: aw take care man
[2025-02-20, 2:43:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: court confirmed 8-10 AM saturday
[2025-02-20, 2:49:47 PM] Santiago: Dis the “rash” I was telling you about. It’s basically chickenpox making a resurgence in a localized area. Most ppl get chickenpox during childhood (yall prob got it) and retain the dormant virus in the spinal cord. If you get stressed or immune system drops, it reappears in the form of shingles. Most ppl get it at least once in their lifetime.
[2025-02-20, 2:50:10 PM] Santiago: Not really contagious as most adults have had chickenpox
[2025-02-20, 2:51:16 PM] Santiago: It’s hand down one of the worst chronic pains I’ve ever had
[2025-02-20, 2:52:23 PM] Santiago: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054
[2025-02-20, 2:57:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: oh shit bro u need anything??
[2025-02-20, 2:57:38 PM] Shardul Bansal: that’s horrible
[2025-02-20, 2:57:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: u never had chicken pox growing up?
[2025-02-20, 2:59:58 PM] Santiago: I did! I got it when I was a baby. Shingles is basically that same virus making a resurgence in a localized area(right hip for me) . Future Cabin Chat topic. I’m sure at least one of you will get it in your lifetime, so I’ll share some tips 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-02-20, 3:17:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: oooof i hope not
[2025-02-20, 3:21:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What are the odds on @16138999983 telling us about his sweet new pharma job with Shingrix next week?
[2025-02-20, 3:25:34 PM] Santiago: I mean, if I show up with 4 aero 98s, brand new tennis mobile, and personal ace pass 🤷🏽‍♂️
[2025-02-20, 3:57:34 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Honestly worth it
[2025-02-20, 4:42:38 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Wait what
[2025-02-20, 4:42:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: BRO
[2025-02-20, 4:42:47 PM] Avi Mehrotra: THATS AMAZING
[2025-02-20, 4:43:14 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Unsure if you didn't get my joke or if I don't get yours...
[2025-02-20, 4:47:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’m stupid today
[2025-02-20, 4:47:48 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Just like most days
[2025-02-21, 7:30:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tennis tomorrow ya?
[2025-02-21, 7:31:00 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: 8am
[2025-02-21, 7:31:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: What court we get @16472039624 ?
[2025-02-21, 7:36:22 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I HAVE BEEN PRACTICIKNG WAKING UP AT 6
[2025-02-21, 7:36:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: For this day
[2025-02-21, 7:36:35 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I am motherfucking ready
[2025-02-21, 7:36:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I believe in you
[2025-02-21, 7:37:02 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: You're the champion of waking up early Avi.
[2025-02-21, 7:37:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And to celebrate your belief in me, coffee on the way back pls and thanks
[2025-02-21, 7:38:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Let's do it boss 🫡
[2025-02-21, 8:28:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: absolutely
[2025-02-21, 8:29:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Have you changed? Are you coffee person now? I can love you now?
[2025-02-21, 8:29:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: Court 4!!
[2025-02-21, 8:30:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: u still can’t love me, i don’t drink coffee still but im down to hang
[2025-02-21, 8:30:36 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I will convert you. Even if it’s last thing I do.
[2025-02-21, 8:32:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: i literally got converted from coffee to non-coffee guy through meditation
[2025-02-21, 8:32:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: No chance you can convert me back
[2025-02-21, 8:32:50 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds like you need to meditate less
[2025-02-21, 8:32:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: which is honestly a shame because i do love the taste
[2025-02-21, 8:33:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha this is the right direction
[2025-02-21, 8:35:04 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Do you get anxiety from coffee? It's actually supposed to be "good for you" in small to moderate doses (1 cup/day).
[2025-02-21, 8:38:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Morherfucking truth
[2025-02-21, 8:38:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ve dropped this fact about a gazillion times on this man
[2025-02-21, 9:09:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: i just cant sleep
[2025-02-21, 9:09:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: he has, but i just cant sleep
[2025-02-21, 9:10:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So drink it  in the morning. Caffeine has a half life of about 6 hours
[2025-02-21, 9:11:52 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: That's an average. Variable person to person
[2025-02-21, 9:13:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Id imagine it wouldn’t vary that drastically though.
[2025-02-21, 9:13:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: about an hour here and there
[2025-02-21, 9:13:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Half life = the time it takes for half of something to decay
[2025-02-21, 9:14:31 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Meaning that even if he has a slight increase in the time variance (say be 1 hour) at 14 hours he has 1/4 of it left.
[2025-02-21, 9:18:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Right. Makes sense. Follow up: with  prolonged exposure, would half life decrease? Actually no, half life wouldn’t change but your body would increase the amount of adenosine receptors to compensate
[2025-02-21, 9:18:29 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Right?
[2025-02-21, 9:18:48 PM] Avi Mehrotra: So the effects of caffeine would be weaker
[2025-02-21, 9:19:22 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Sounds plausible but I'm not so familiar with hormones etc.
[2025-02-21, 9:20:27 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Moral of the story is that we keep shoving coffee down Shardul
[2025-02-21, 9:20:33 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm pro this
[2025-02-21, 9:20:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Till he stops being a lil bitch
[2025-02-21, 9:21:08 PM] Avi Mehrotra: #science
[2025-02-21, 9:23:13 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Time to put the experimental in experimental biology
[2025-02-21, 10:14:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: this is gonna be hard
[2025-02-21, 11:17:56 PM] Santiago: Have you tried matcha coach @16472039624? Been loving it. Coffee was fucking up too bad
[2025-02-21, 11:20:09 PM] Aayush: so it’s @16472039624 @16047827064 @17788869646 and myself tmrw then?

[2025-02-22, 10:09:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: https://maps.app.goo.gl/s1LxdZppy7nT4t2K9?g_st=aw
[2025-02-22, 10:38:13 AM] Santiago: Huge fomo 😭😭😭
[2025-02-22, 10:39:12 AM] Santiago: Not enough 😞
[2025-02-22, 11:06:54 AM] ~ Vijay: Maybe black coffee, no sugar

[2025-03-01, 7:06:38 PM] Aayush: who else is playing in addition to @16472039624 @16043553859 ?
[2025-03-01, 7:09:10 PM] Avi Mehrotra: There’s a guy on Reddit who does a shot of whiskey before every match to calm his nerves
[2025-03-01, 7:09:18 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Apparently an effective strategy
[2025-03-01, 7:09:26 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Has a solid win rate
[2025-03-01, 7:09:31 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I think you should try it
[2025-03-01, 7:09:39 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You’re crazy enough to pull it off
[2025-03-01, 8:56:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: thats lowkey brilliant
[2025-03-01, 9:17:25 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I agree. It’s enough to uninhibit you but not enough to cause you to lose any motor functionality
[2025-03-02, 1:17:25 PM] Santiago: Coach @17788869646 and I planning a tentative Friday eve sesh. Who in? Ace pass daddy @16472039624 ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-03-02, 9:54:43 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Bruh I'm not going to destroy my YouTube algorithm
[2025-03-02, 9:55:06 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Do you know how long it's taken to stop being recommended Pickleball videos with 8 views?
[2025-03-02, 9:55:31 PM] Santiago: Make it 9 views now
[2025-03-02, 10:00:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha
[2025-03-02, 10:00:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: genie bouchard tho 👀
[2025-03-02, 10:01:11 PM] Santiago: Dis how they get the 9 views
[2025-03-02, 10:01:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahahaha
[2025-03-02, 11:52:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The pickleball association diminishes her attractiveness, traitor. Plenty of hotties in TENNIS.
[2025-03-03, 8:15:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmuuzYkbKX0
[2025-03-03, 8:15:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: first 2 min of this is cathartic
[2025-03-03, 8:16:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: i wanna do some down-the-middle hitting, anyone up for a 1v1 wednesday morning?

[2025-03-05, 10:21:57 AM] ~ Vijay: You can say no man its all good
[2025-03-05, 10:22:37 AM] Shardul Bansal: we got 1 court for 7-9 pm, it’s the bubble tho
[2025-03-05, 11:26:41 AM] Santiago: Is it locked in?

[2025-03-07, 10:24:26 PM] Santiago: Black clean kanteen
[2025-03-07, 10:24:39 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I did not
[2025-03-07, 10:24:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: nahhhh dont got it
[2025-03-07, 10:24:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Maybe on the table at ubc
[2025-03-07, 10:25:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: u can likely call ‘em to keep it at the front desk for next time, they’re open till 11
[2025-03-07, 10:25:15 PM] Santiago: Yah, that’s prob where I left it 😢
[2025-03-07, 10:30:18 PM] Santiago: Yah, they found it
[2025-03-08, 9:46:59 AM] Santiago: Ohh fack! Don’t show this to @17788869646 https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00648-5
[2025-03-08, 9:47:28 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I believe this
[2025-03-08, 9:48:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: But who is checking the errors in the AI's error checker (I didnt read the article).
[2025-03-08, 9:48:33 AM] Santiago: Errors all the way down 😂
[2025-03-08, 9:49:01 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: It's easy when you've stolen and fed the sum of the world's knowledge into an LLM to go and look at a paper from 2010 based on out of date knowledge and be like HAH!
[2025-03-08, 9:52:55 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: "Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish"

This is a terrible idea.
[2025-03-08, 9:54:20 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I would be pro using this to check every AI paper that's published
[2025-03-08, 10:03:21 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Idk it's like fine. It's a tool. As long as they're not stealing my work when I submit it to this thing and I don't need to get 100% error free rate on a thing that has a "10% false positive rate" then whatever.
[2025-03-08, 10:25:06 AM] Santiago: Omg don’t tell @16472039624it’s just a tool 😬. To him it’s AGI ‎<This message was edited>
[2025-03-08, 10:26:37 AM] Santiago: Curious how it could possibly help ppl write better, specially if you are ESL 🧐
[2025-03-08, 10:29:23 AM] Santiago: help highlight weaknesses in the methodology? find references that were missed or worth reviewing in detail? All these things would just be an extension of the human, and not a replacement for one
[2025-03-08, 10:34:27 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'm open to this if the journal implementing this hires a human to fact check the AI
[2025-03-08, 10:36:35 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Like it has uses, maybe this is a good one. I don't think checking methodology is particularly useful. That's not like a standardized thing. Often methodology is also novel
[2025-03-08, 10:37:05 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Athletic greens 1?
[2025-03-08, 10:44:58 AM] Santiago: *Shardul Bansal has left the group*
[2025-03-08, 11:32:13 AM] ~ Vijay: AI is an infant, probably not up for that kind of responsibility yet
[2025-03-08, 11:37:35 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think that it's useful, I simply fear the general public (and a lot of the people funding the production of) has a lack of literacy in the topic. Which clashes poorly with the fact that everyone interacts with it constantly.
[2025-03-09, 10:09:18 PM] Santiago: Gents, coach @17788869646 and I interested in a Friday sesh. Who in?
[2025-03-09, 10:09:58 PM] Aayush: me
[2025-03-09, 11:33:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: im out but happy to book

[2025-03-11, 9:57:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: no courts available in center
[2025-03-11, 10:00:01 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: The bubble courts always feel a little crazy to me, like they're nice. But the court speed feels so fast and the temperature gradient is weird
[2025-03-11, 10:01:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: since the resurfacing they feel pre good but the temp gradient is for sure annoying, heaters right above the baseline are 10000% not the play ‎<This message was edited>

[2025-03-28, 7:03:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: How’s our boy doing?

[2025-03-28, 7:48:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Tough luck bro
[2025-03-28, 7:48:23 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Lefty serves are always tricky
[2025-03-28, 8:29:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: duuude thats close
[2025-03-28, 8:29:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: my guy was a bust, 6-2, 4-1 and he retired 😓
[2025-03-28, 9:34:33 PM] Avi Mehrotra: A win is a win
[2025-03-28, 9:37:13 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Dude you should have played 4.5
[2025-03-28, 9:37:46 PM] Avi Mehrotra: You’re a solid 4.5 player
[2025-03-28, 9:37:55 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The challenge would have made it a lot more fun
[2025-03-28, 9:45:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: honestly, match play is so much about confidence, I know the second and third round will be better
[2025-03-28, 9:45:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: love to just flex the match play muscle after not having done it for years
[2025-03-28, 9:46:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: I also still didn’t play great tennis. I was just focusing on one thing, which was movement of my feet to always be behind the ball.
[2025-03-28, 9:56:47 PM] Shardul Bansal: my next opp i know will be good, he plays a lot at Stanley Park and is a very reliable player
[2025-03-28, 10:34:42 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Wins a win, congrats
[2025-03-28, 10:34:57 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I think going in 4.0 early is a good idea
[2025-03-29, 1:17:01 AM] Aayush: dude Chris Mariano isn’t that good, i beat him 6-0 6-0 last year with an injured shoulder
[2025-03-29, 10:11:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: ok well fuck imma try not being shit
[2025-03-29, 11:15:59 AM] Avi Mehrotra: Here’s the advice I gave Aayush: Don’t play like a little bitch.
[2025-03-29, 11:16:50 AM] Avi Mehrotra: And don’t be a pussy. Make that ball your bitch. Within reason, and in the right context
[2025-03-29, 12:06:08 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Avi trying to make an army of glass cannons
[2025-03-29, 12:06:21 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Hahahahaha

[2025-03-29, 6:04:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: ground strokes weren’t bad, my serve is just too unreliable
[2025-03-29, 7:07:37 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Elaborate
[2025-03-29, 8:23:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: my toss was just dog shit, it was everywhere
[2025-03-29, 9:11:12 PM] Avi Mehrotra: I might be down to play on Monday. Show me then

[2025-03-30, 1:26:16 AM] Avi Mehrotra: You’re coming.
[2025-03-30, 1:26:22 AM] Avi Mehrotra: There, convinced.
[2025-03-30, 9:42:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: there are no courts
‎[2025-03-30, 9:43:43 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: ‎image omitted
[2025-03-30, 9:43:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: unless someone wants to play 4-6 pm tomorrow
[2025-03-30, 9:43:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m up for this!
[2025-03-30, 9:44:51 AM] Shardul Bansal: there’s a couple courts from 8-10pm tonight but I can’t play then
[2025-03-30, 9:45:29 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Keep an eye on Tuesday or Wednesday morning?
[2025-03-30, 9:45:56 AM] Shardul Bansal: False creek type shit?
[2025-03-30, 9:46:14 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: Or Heather park
[2025-03-30, 9:46:33 AM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll cruise over to FC tomorrow and double check there are not lakes on all the courts
[2025-03-30, 9:46:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: sweet, Heather Park is only a 15 min bike ride for me, ideal
[2025-03-30, 6:06:41 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Okay I got two new sticks to try out. So I’m exxxxxtra keen to hit a ball around
[2025-03-30, 6:07:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Actually maybe works
[2025-03-30, 6:07:44 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Oooooo what you get??
[2025-03-30, 7:30:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: TF40
[2025-03-30, 7:31:04 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And 16x19 Blade
[2025-03-30, 7:33:02 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: TF40 sounds like it's also just the blade from its stats
[2025-03-30, 7:56:53 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Yeah, it’s like a blade with a very comfortable handle.
[2025-03-30, 7:58:07 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Wilson racquets these days have a very exaggerated flare on the buttcap of the handle, which makes them very uncomfortable to hold
[2025-03-30, 7:58:40 PM] Avi Mehrotra: The tf40 just feels right
[2025-03-30, 7:59:08 PM] Avi Mehrotra: And the demo racquet is brand new and freshly strung and I’m a little too excited to hit with it
[2025-03-30, 8:01:30 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Have you hit with it yet?
[2025-03-30, 8:01:46 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I've heard a lot of people don't like the TF grips
[2025-03-30, 8:05:16 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Not yet
[2025-03-30, 8:05:47 PM] Avi Mehrotra: THATS WHY WE NEED TO HIT TOMORROW DR. TANSKANEN
[2025-03-30, 8:11:19 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I can't make it to UBC for 4 ☹️
[2025-03-30, 8:20:43 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Nah not ubc
[2025-03-30, 8:20:52 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Outdoors, weather permitting
[2025-03-30, 8:21:25 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Hmm, I could maybe get to False creek at 5?
[2025-03-30, 8:21:32 PM] Avi Mehrotra: Works
[2025-03-30, 8:22:12 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: I'll bring my stuff

[2025-03-30, 10:20:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: Likely it’ll rain tonight, but if not, can we run a couple of singles sessions tomorrow at 5 pm?
[2025-03-30, 10:56:57 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: Supposed to stop raining at 11-12 tomorrow
[2025-03-30, 10:57:07 PM] Adrian Tanskanen: So if it's light rain it should be dry
[2025-03-31, 1:17:53 AM] Avi Mehrotra: I’ll keep an eye out

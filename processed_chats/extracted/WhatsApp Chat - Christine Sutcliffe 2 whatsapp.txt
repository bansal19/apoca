[2024-01-25, 1:54:07 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: hey! just shooting a message to see how you are! and how you’re doing back in vancouver!
[2024-01-25, 10:16:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: Hey Christine!! How’s it going? Got the place to yourself in London I hear! Honestly, yea hasnt been too bad with the breakup, been focusing on tennis and meditation ahaha
[2024-04-02, 2:37:06 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Let me know how the visa application goes!
[2024-04-02, 2:37:45 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: My dad is flying to London and will stay with me on Wednesday April 10 night, and Sunday April 14 night,  but otherwise I have a set of keys and you’re totally welcome to crash!
[2024-04-02, 3:32:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’m hoping it comes thru before the end of the week and I can get there by the weekend! Thanks for offering Christine, I’ll keep you posted!
[2024-04-02, 3:32:23 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Super !! So exciting !
[2024-04-08, 8:59:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: Hey Christine, haven’t received my passport yet and I was hoping I’d be over in London by now! Hoping to receive it today and fly out right after! I wanted to find out if I might be able to crash at yours Tuesday night? That’d be super helpful!
[2024-04-08, 9:25:38 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: Hey!! Tomorrow Tuesday? Yes of course !!
[2024-04-08, 9:39:26 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: My dad is here Wednesday night, but then we’re going out to the Lake District until the weekend. If you want to stay at mine for a few nights, I could probably leave my keys with the front desk!
[2024-04-08, 10:02:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: Amazing! Thank you!
[2024-04-08, 10:03:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: that will be really nice! I’ll ask around EF if there’s folks staying together, would love to stay with em!
[2024-04-08, 10:08:59 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: Let’s me know !! Sounds good to me.
[2024-04-08, 10:09:32 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: I’m so excited for you! As someone who was not so sure about moving to London 18 months, it’s literally THE BEST
[2024-04-08, 10:09:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: ahahahah really?
[2024-04-08, 10:09:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: imma need you to show me all the good spots
[2024-04-08, 10:12:30 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: yeeeee you got it 🤙🏽
[2024-04-08, 10:17:20 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: Couple quick things for the first few days - 

Phone: get a pay as you go data pack (no contract) from one of the cell providers — 3, EE, O2 all fine options. You should be able to get like 8-12 GB data with call/texting month for about £10-12. 

Banks - generally easiest to open up an account with one of the e-banks. Revolut, Monzo, Starlink. I use revolut and it’s great - good spending insights, you get a proper bank number/transfer number, and free transfers in/out/internationally. 

Canada’s shoppers drug mart = UK Boots if you need any essentials. 

Tesco/Morrisons/Sainsbury/Aldi = cheaper grocery stores. M&S/Waitrose = posh grocery stores 

Download CityMapper for transit, Santander bikes app for city cycles (you can pay £20/month for unlimited use)
[2024-04-08, 10:21:25 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: The community gyms are called “Better Health” and they have 100s of them - some have pools, running tracks, or classes in addition to gym. You can pay per time, or getting a monthly pass 

Gail’s is a super reliable coffee shop you can find across the city. Wifi / seating / really nice drinks and pastries / some have hot food like eggs and soup - it’s nicer than a Starbucks or Pret
[2024-04-08, 11:30:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: Wowowwwwww this is soooo helpful damn thanks Christine!!!
[2024-04-08, 11:30:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: love this!
[2024-04-08, 12:34:17 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: And if you’re able to fly tonight 

My address is 1 Handyside St, apartment F3-08, London, N1C 4BQ 

You can take the Thameslink (one of the London train lines) from Gatwick to “St Pancras” if you get into Gatwick. I’m like 10 min walk from St Pancras 

Or if you fly to Heathrow, take the Heathrow express train to Paddington. Then transfer to the subway line “Circle/Hammersmith” and take it to Kings Cross 

Slightly longer but cheaper by 20£ is to get on the Piccadilly underground at Heathrow and ride it about 70 min to Kings Cross ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-04-12, 1:33:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: no, you’ve honestly been such a lovely host the place is kept beautifully, thanks for organizing all my stuff really appreciate it!
[2024-04-12, 1:33:41 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Feel free to do laundry if you need! Pods for it + the dish washer are under the sink
[2024-04-12, 1:34:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: that’s great to know but unlike ur boyfriend i like to pack like 10 tees ahahaha

[2024-04-12, 1:40:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: nervous?
[2024-04-12, 1:41:10 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Uh oh should I be
[2024-04-12, 1:41:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: no
[2024-04-12, 1:41:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: but i know u were
[2024-04-12, 1:41:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: he’s literally been focusing on his breathing for 20 hours in the past 2 days
[2024-04-12, 1:43:14 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Yeah, I get it’s silly for me to be nervous when he’s the one doing the course 🙈 

I think times of separation make me realize, he’s the first person I want to share things with and I feel very deeply connected to him. So it’s hard being separated and not knowing what he’s thinking / how he’s doing
[2024-04-12, 1:43:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: hmnnnn yea, love will do that to ya
[2024-04-12, 1:43:59 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: 🥲🥲
[2024-04-12, 1:44:41 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Thanks for checking in and asking!!
[2024-04-12, 1:44:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: He’s a guy so i can help with what hes thinking about
[2024-04-12, 1:45:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: dickballs.ai
[2024-04-12, 1:45:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: but also how his bum is so hairless but all the other boys’ bums aren’t
[2024-04-12, 1:46:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: and then he’ll be thinking about you
[2024-04-12, 1:46:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: and then the boys and how love is such a beautiful thing
[2024-04-12, 1:47:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: If he’s like me, he’ll be all over
[2024-04-12, 1:47:21 PM] Shardul Bansal: but he’s already got some meditation xp, so he’s probably actually focussing on breathing
[2024-04-12, 1:51:05 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Even with meditation experience I feel like part of it will always be all over the place
[2024-04-12, 1:51:11 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I bet he’s also thinking about my dog 😂
[2024-04-12, 1:51:16 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: What should we do on Monday eve?
[2024-04-12, 1:51:24 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: This is helpful tho
[2024-04-12, 2:27:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: i ended up digging into some dinner!

[2024-04-12, 2:28:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: make some saucy plans, you wanna invite some folks out as well?
[2024-04-12, 2:28:31 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Curious to hear your impressions
[2024-04-12, 2:28:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: NAAAAHHHH its ur birthday cele
[2024-04-12, 2:29:07 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: And glad u were able to connect with fam today !! I know there’s excitement but also sometimes good to re-ground with family when you’re in a new place
[2024-04-12, 2:29:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: soooo good, talking to my bro is real cathartic sometimes, he knows what to say
[2024-04-12, 2:34:12 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I wonder if it feels that way bc you’re brothers and so you have similar values !! 

I had a similar feeling w my cousin last week. I saw him last week, and we got on so well. And then I remembered it’s because we’re literally 1/8 the same dna 😂
[2024-04-12, 2:34:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha yea that may be it
[2024-04-13, 8:59:42 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: hows your flat searching going
[2024-04-13, 8:59:56 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: my dad will be staying over tomorrow night, but he leaves monday

[2024-04-13, 9:00:09 AM] Christine Sutcliffe: and in fact you can use mine when i go bck to Canada if you wish
[2024-04-13, 1:18:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: It's going! I've messaged a few folks on messenger but I'm really honestly looking to stay with another EF person. One thing I've learnt in the past 3 months is that I really don't like living alone :/
[2024-04-13, 1:18:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: I'll figure something out before then for sure!
[2024-04-13, 1:19:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: suuuuper sweet to offer, thanks!
[2024-04-13, 1:20:29 PM] Shardul Bansal: how's Lake District with your Dad? Build more character today?
[2024-04-13, 1:21:34 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: yeah! we stayed on some lower peaks today but still racked up about 25 km

[2024-04-13, 1:25:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Staying in a hotel close to EF, playing some early tennis on Monday!
[2024-04-13, 1:25:54 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: will you be back to mine on Monday?
[2024-04-13, 1:26:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: Likely no, hoping to have these marketplace leads pan out by then!
[2024-04-13, 2:07:12 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: do you think getting on a flight the day vipassana ends would be incredibly overwhelming haha
[2024-04-13, 2:08:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahhhh, no, shouldn't be, they make entering the real world a transition in the last day or two
[2024-04-13, 2:08:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: are you thinking about flying straight out from montreal on Sunday
[2024-04-13, 2:08:38 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Yeah, we had that Halifax trip get cancelled 2 years ago
[2024-04-13, 2:09:25 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: and im thinking we go there Sunday night - Thursday and do some surfing + National Parks etc
[2024-04-13, 2:10:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: ooooh that's an idea and a half, I feel like ryan would love that

[2024-04-20, 12:39:38 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I actually think when I have extra mental energy (either work stuff etc) I tend to run a lot longer
[2024-04-20, 12:39:56 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I can’t download photos on the AC wifi 🥲🥲🥲 but I can only imagine
[2024-04-20, 12:40:07 PM] Shardul Bansal: wahddya mean
[2024-04-20, 12:40:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: when u have more on your plate you run for longer?
[2024-04-20, 12:40:37 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: For me it’s less what did I eat / how well do I sleep that dictates distance, 

If I have a busy mind I can run forever
[2024-04-20, 12:40:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahhhhh
[2024-04-20, 12:41:00 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Not busy in a bad way but when I’ve been wound up from a good product review OR extra excitement before travel etc
[2024-04-20, 12:41:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: we’ll have to go running sometime when ur back
[2024-04-20, 12:41:09 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: YE

[2024-04-20, 12:41:43 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I’m trying to get more terrain variation and hills and stuff
[2024-04-20, 12:41:52 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: So maybe Hampstead heath or something could be great
[2024-04-20, 12:42:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: oooh im not a good runner but im super down to get better
[2024-04-20, 12:42:33 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I’m very much in “improving” phase too!!
[2024-04-20, 12:42:47 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: It’s about consistency for me now ! I never know how long il run when I start each run 🥲
[2024-04-20, 12:42:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: just a feeling eh?
[2024-04-20, 12:43:24 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Watching a Pop documentary series about fasting right now and it’s kind of interesting! I’m trying to incorporate that more too
[2024-04-20, 12:43:36 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: But it’s hard because when you exercise a lot you also want to eat 5000 calories after haha
[2024-04-20, 12:43:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha seb wouldnt shut up about it
[2024-04-20, 12:43:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea, found it to be hard when i was tryna gain weight
[2024-04-20, 12:44:09 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I can imagine fasting isn’t good for gaining weight 😂
[2024-04-20, 12:44:37 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: I did intermittent for a bit only eating between like 11 and 4:30 or so
[2024-04-20, 12:44:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh nice, did you feel the effects
[2024-04-20, 12:45:55 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Not really - I think a lot of the benefits come from depleting your body of glucose and switching to ketosis, and I think it might take longer than that to do so ? Idk
[2024-04-20, 12:46:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: Hmm, ive heard that only happens after hour 14
[2024-04-20, 12:46:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: of not eating
[2024-04-20, 12:46:59 PM] Christine Sutcliffe: Also it’s really hard when you want to be social and go to dinner and stuff with people lol
[2024-04-20, 12:47:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea that too

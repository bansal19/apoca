[2023-09-16, 4:12:18 AM] Abbey Desta: Absolutely. I am free around 1pm or 2pm PST. Does that work?
[2023-09-16, 12:26:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: Shoot literally the only time of the day I’m not free 😬, how’s about a couple hours after that?
[2023-09-16, 2:02:53 PM] Abbey Desta: I think that can work
[2023-09-16, 2:03:04 PM] Abbey Desta: Shoot me a message when you’re free

[2024-01-16, 8:58:36 AM] Abbey Desta: How are things going my friend?
[2024-01-16, 1:46:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: They’re going man, lotta big changes in my personal life but I’m back in Van and ready to grind! How’re things on your end?
[2024-01-16, 1:47:03 PM] Abbey Desta: Break up?
[2024-01-16, 1:47:42 PM] Abbey Desta: Hope you’re all good my friend
[2024-01-16, 1:47:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: yessssir
[2024-01-16, 1:48:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: 5 years, it’s alright tho, no hard feelings
[2024-01-16, 1:48:27 PM] Abbey Desta: Man, that’s a big change
[2024-01-16, 1:48:40 PM] Abbey Desta: Might be one of the biggest ones in your life to date
[2024-01-16, 1:48:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: It just made sense, tryna keep my head down and stay focused tho
[2024-01-16, 1:49:09 PM] Abbey Desta: You guys are both good people
[2024-01-16, 1:49:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, meditation and tennis keeping me sane
[2024-01-16, 1:49:30 PM] Abbey Desta: Im sure you treated each other respectfully
[2024-01-16, 1:49:33 PM] Abbey Desta: Good man
[2024-01-16, 1:49:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: Tryna add work to the mix but cant really build much of a rhythm
[2024-01-16, 1:49:55 PM] Abbey Desta: It will be difficult
[2024-01-16, 1:50:04 PM] Abbey Desta: In time you’ll get back to baseline
[2024-01-16, 1:50:09 PM] Abbey Desta: To sea level
[2024-01-16, 1:51:43 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea cheers man, it’s not been as tough as I would’ve thought
[2024-01-16, 1:52:07 PM] Abbey Desta: You made the right decision then
[2024-01-16, 1:52:35 PM] Abbey Desta: You back at AwS?
[2024-01-16, 2:12:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: Nahhh, still trying my hand at founding, tryna pick up the pace tho
[2024-01-16, 2:13:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: Let’s have a call sometime soon, itll light the fire for me to have made some progress
[2024-01-16, 2:39:30 PM] Abbey Desta: let’s do it
[2024-01-16, 2:39:33 PM] Abbey Desta: next week
[2024-01-31, 5:12:09 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yo Abbey how’s it going, looking forward to our chat next week. I have a favour to ask you, you mind connecting me with Maz via a group chat or email? I’ve been trying to text him but havent heard back, it’d be useful for me to conduct some initial research!
[2024-01-31, 5:15:30 PM] Shardul Bansal: Nvm, just tried another follow up and I got in touch!
[2024-02-01, 4:06:15 AM] Abbey Desta: ok ok
[2024-02-01, 4:06:18 AM] Abbey Desta: good luck!
[2024-02-06, 9:22:07 AM] Abbey Desta: see you later today
[2024-02-06, 11:27:23 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yup yuup!
[2024-02-07, 4:53:29 AM] Abbey Desta: I just give you his whatsapp
[2024-02-07, 5:40:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: Who’s whatsapp? Maz?
[2024-02-07, 5:40:40 AM] Abbey Desta: Facundo
[2024-02-07, 5:40:43 AM] Abbey Desta: my dev
[2024-02-07, 5:41:17 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh right! Yes, send it over. Ill likely connect with him once i have an mvp up
[2024-02-07, 5:41:24 AM] Abbey Desta: aha ok ok

[2024-02-17, 11:02:05 AM] Shardul Bansal: what book is that? Looks like an interesting read
[2024-02-17, 11:05:51 AM] Abbey Desta: Right?!
[2024-02-17, 11:06:02 AM] Abbey Desta: A collection of books you should read
[2024-02-17, 11:06:17 AM] Abbey Desta: All about venture capital
[2024-02-17, 11:08:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: oh nice, name of a book to start?
[2024-02-17, 11:12:10 AM] Abbey Desta: I will send you the collection
[2024-02-17, 11:19:36 AM] Abbey Desta: https://www.google.com.ar/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Stephen+R.+Poland%22
[2024-02-17, 11:19:48 AM] Abbey Desta: His collection
[2024-02-17, 11:20:31 AM] Shardul Bansal: Nice, im doing YC startup school as well, which covers a bit of this, but thanks for sending over, will check them out
[2024-02-17, 11:23:32 AM] Abbey Desta: It’s a good read. Very digestible
[2024-02-17, 11:23:36 AM] Abbey Desta: Amazing
[2024-02-17, 11:23:43 AM] Abbey Desta: When do you start?
[2024-02-17, 11:24:28 AM] Shardul Bansal: Its an async program they run, but i started this week
[2024-02-17, 11:28:10 AM] Abbey Desta: Async will be handy
[2024-02-17, 11:28:17 AM] Abbey Desta: Good idea
[2024-02-17, 12:05:38 PM] Abbey Desta: Intellirunbook
[2024-02-17, 12:05:44 PM] Abbey Desta: Runbook.ai was taken?
[2024-02-17, 2:55:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly didnt think about runbook.ai
[2024-02-17, 2:56:26 PM] Abbey Desta: I think it’s available
[2024-02-17, 2:56:31 PM] Abbey Desta: but you will have to buy
[2024-02-17, 2:56:32 PM] Abbey Desta: it
[2024-02-17, 2:56:42 PM] Abbey Desta: just use whatever is available now and buy a nice one when you’re ready
[2024-02-17, 2:57:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://intellirunbook.notion.site/IntelliRunbook-203bd0b63fea408e94666aa0b5a33065
[2024-02-17, 2:57:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: Super simple landing page just to get out there
[2024-02-17, 3:16:17 PM] Abbey Desta: ok
[2024-02-17, 3:16:19 PM] Abbey Desta: copy is great
[2024-02-17, 3:16:31 PM] Abbey Desta: landing page can be improved a lot
[2024-02-17, 3:16:41 PM] Abbey Desta: with just a bit of help
[2024-02-17, 8:11:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: Oh please, im all ears man
[2024-02-18, 4:32:18 AM] Abbey Desta: whats the plan with the website? you want to use it to get customers?
[2024-02-18, 8:03:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: I want to pilot the product with it
[2024-02-18, 8:06:33 AM] Abbey Desta: Make it better then
[2024-02-18, 8:06:48 AM] Abbey Desta: If you want we can help
[2024-02-18, 8:07:29 AM] Abbey Desta: For the price of 0 dollars
[2024-02-18, 11:10:01 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ahahaha, ok, it’s just a simple landing page but the MVP is something I’m working on
[2024-02-18, 11:18:37 AM] Abbey Desta: Pilot meaning try get some users?
[2024-02-18, 11:19:00 AM] Abbey Desta: Okie doke. Let me know how it goes and if you need a hand
[2024-02-18, 12:02:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: Trying to figure out product market fit!
[2024-02-19, 2:33:02 PM] Shardul Bansal: so, came across some unfortunately really neat alternatives to intellirunbook: 

1. https://scribehow.com/
2. https://www.guidde.com/compare/guidde-vs-scribe
3. https://www.tango.us/

All of the above do the advertised tasks of intelligent runbooks well. Guidde seems to be the most feature rich. The goal with IntelliRunbook in the long term would be to not only automate the runbook creation but automate the runbook mitigation as well. Process capture —> process completion. These companies don’t look like they’re doing that just yet but could be on the agenda. AdeptAI is technically working on process capture --> actual process execution
[2024-02-19, 2:34:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: what're your thoughts? I'm also exploring some ideas in the climate tech space that seem much more promising
[2024-02-19, 2:35:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: Going through startup school for YC and they recommend hard problems, because if you're pouring blood sweat and tears in this journey, might as well pick something hard.
[2024-02-20, 4:43:00 AM] Abbey Desta: Shardul
[2024-02-20, 4:43:18 AM] Abbey Desta: it’s true that solving hard problems is good
[2024-02-20, 4:43:35 AM] Abbey Desta: you’ll find that theres less competition
[2024-02-20, 4:43:47 AM] Abbey Desta: climate tech?
[2024-02-20, 4:43:53 AM] Abbey Desta: do share more
[2024-02-20, 4:44:43 AM] Abbey Desta: yes these are great
[2024-02-20, 4:44:57 AM] Abbey Desta: so you feel as though there is not much point in going down this road?
[2024-02-20, 7:44:51 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, i feel like this specific industry is super saturated
[2024-02-20, 7:45:14 AM] Abbey Desta: you free for a wa call today?
[2024-02-20, 7:45:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: Today is stacked, would tomorrow work?
[2024-02-20, 7:47:19 AM] Abbey Desta: lets give it a go
[2024-02-20, 7:48:31 AM] Shardul Bansal: How’s around 11 AM pst tomorrow?
[2024-02-21, 10:01:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: sent u a calendar invite for 11, lemme know if that works
[2024-02-21, 10:08:42 AM] Abbey Desta: Got it
[2024-02-21, 10:08:48 AM] Abbey Desta: WhatsApp call ok?
[2024-02-21, 10:19:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: yup, should be perf
[2024-02-21, 10:21:28 AM] Abbey Desta: Ok super
[2024-02-21, 10:21:34 AM] Abbey Desta: I’m free in a few mins
[2024-02-21, 10:22:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: I just need 20!
[2024-02-21, 10:28:11 AM] Abbey Desta: ‎Voice call, ‎39 min
[2024-02-23, 10:47:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: Haven't had the chance to meet with farmers who would use this just yet but got some more clarity into the product use case: 
SOP Lagoon (https://www.sopfarm.com/sectors/livestock-effluents/SOP-Lagoon) is this additive that's added to cow shit. Results in 80% reduction of Methane and 75% reduction of CO2 emissions. The current incentive for farmers to use this is dissolving any crusts or sediment, keeping it the shit fluid, and removing the smell. The big incentive we can add is to create revenue for farmers by generating carbon credits. There's Athean.ai (https://www.athian.ai/methods) that has created a market for this specific types of carbon-credit based solutions in agriculture. They should accept this solution as an easy way to verify credits (assumption that requires validation still). 

It's super early, but I think there's something absolutely real here. Farmers get a way to get fair compensation for reducing GHG emissions.
[2024-02-24, 1:45:33 AM] Abbey Desta: Making them money form the system
[2024-02-24, 1:45:35 AM] Abbey Desta: Love it
[2024-02-25, 1:54:47 AM] Abbey Desta: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3l7vc1ucD_/?igsh=MTFqeTNpdW5mbmx1NA==
[2024-02-25, 1:55:59 AM] Abbey Desta: This is just to give you an idea of the difference between major policy coming out by gov vs what industries actually believe. This opinion is across the board with the big manufacturers.
[2024-02-25, 10:09:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: Well... I feel like the largest plug in hybrid EV manufacturer is going to continue saying they made the right bet going down that road
[2024-02-25, 10:09:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars
[2024-02-25, 10:12:30 AM] Abbey Desta: It’s everyone
[2024-02-25, 10:12:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: ^ experts that agree that a single EV in its lifetime actually has a smaller carbon footprint than gas/hybrid or PHEV vehicle.
[2024-02-25, 10:12:49 AM] Abbey Desta: I work in the industry remember.
[2024-02-25, 10:12:55 AM] Abbey Desta: I’m dealing with these guys all the time.
[2024-02-25, 10:13:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: VW is the other largest car manufacturer -- https://www.vw.com/en/electric-vehicles.html
[2024-02-25, 10:13:12 AM] Shardul Bansal: and they've taken a different route to Toyota
[2024-02-25, 10:15:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: I guess the fact that VW has a electric lineup doesn't necessarily mean that there's a belief in electric, they could just be following regulation and policy, as you said
[2024-02-25, 10:16:26 AM] Abbey Desta: Yes
[2024-02-25, 10:18:16 AM] Abbey Desta: https://fortune.com/europe/2024/02/03/germany-electric-vehicle-sales-drop-carmakers-audi-vw-bmw/
[2024-02-25, 10:19:05 AM] Abbey Desta: You probably already know this but the gov give a lot of financial incentives for people to buy Evs
[2024-02-25, 10:19:13 AM] Abbey Desta: It’s crazy. Thousands of dollars a car.
[2024-02-25, 10:19:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: Right, lotta tax break
[2024-02-25, 10:19:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: *breaks
[2024-02-25, 10:19:28 AM] Abbey Desta: And that is not sustainable
[2024-02-25, 10:19:41 AM] Abbey Desta: The gov can’t prop up the sector forever
[2024-02-25, 10:20:58 AM] Abbey Desta: The amount of rare earth and metals required to make these batteries is crazy. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-25, 10:22:04 AM] Abbey Desta: There will be money to be made in the climate space probably
[2024-02-25, 10:22:57 AM] Abbey Desta: But it’s a massive political play. It’s really depends on if the US can still tell every country and company in the world what to do.
[2024-02-25, 10:22:59 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yes, that's fair. Lithium is the key element that's driving up costs, it would be cool to see development in battery technology away from lithium, but that's likely half a decade away at the very least
[2024-02-25, 10:23:28 AM] Abbey Desta: We will have to see how it plays out.
[2024-02-25, 10:23:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: Considering the money that's being poured in the climate tech space, I feel that might continue to be a possibility
[2024-02-25, 10:24:21 AM] Abbey Desta: See if you can get some of it!
[2024-02-25, 10:26:02 AM] Abbey Desta: The key is to focus on the fundamentals. First principles. Be wary of hype, trend etc.
[2024-03-07, 12:59:26 PM] Abbey Desta: Shardul
[2024-03-07, 12:59:36 PM] Abbey Desta: What’s going on my friend?
[2024-03-07, 3:58:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Abbeyyy bud, going well, just tryna bootstrap this dMRV project which has kept me busy, how are you??
[2024-03-07, 3:58:26 PM] Abbey Desta: dMRV?
[2024-03-07, 3:58:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: digital Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
[2024-03-07, 3:58:56 PM] Abbey Desta: ohhhh
[2024-03-07, 3:58:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: For the carbon credits idea so that farmers can make $$$
[2024-03-07, 3:59:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, the more I get introduced to it, the more I feel like it’s real messy
[2024-03-07, 3:59:53 PM] Abbey Desta: ohhh haha ok this they will like
[2024-03-07, 3:59:56 PM] Abbey Desta: now you’re thinking!
[2024-03-07, 4:00:20 PM] Abbey Desta: farmers will adopt it if it helps them game the system
[2024-03-07, 4:00:50 PM] Abbey Desta: sure, but once you have mass adoption you can find a way to build a network effect into it for defensibility
[2024-03-07, 4:01:14 PM] Abbey Desta: the making money from carbon credits is the “in" ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-07, 4:01:21 PM] Abbey Desta: but surely it can be much more than that
[2024-03-07, 4:01:48 PM] Abbey Desta: keep pulling on that thread, will be interesting to see what you discover ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-07, 5:08:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: Was doing the initial product market fit for a 250 cow-head dairy farm, the farmer can make roughly $25k annually back
[2024-03-07, 5:14:32 PM] Abbey Desta: nice
[2024-03-07, 7:00:41 PM] Abbey Desta: would love to hear more

[2024-03-10, 1:17:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, they’ve pivoted that entire team to AI research, saw that
[2024-03-10, 1:18:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: absolutely
[2024-03-10, 1:20:07 PM] Abbey Desta: Yes. Good move, really.

[2024-04-28, 9:27:40 AM] Shardul Bansal: walks are the best to regain energy, you doing any of that? hard in dubai tho
[2024-04-28, 9:28:09 AM] Abbey Desta: A few ideas.
Creating a fiscally profile. Like a financial services passport. Allowing customers to easily interface with financial services
[2024-04-28, 9:28:17 AM] Abbey Desta: Good idea
[2024-04-28, 9:28:31 AM] Abbey Desta: A network effect business.
[2024-04-28, 9:28:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: ooooooh cold start problem eh
[2024-04-28, 9:28:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: not impossible
[2024-04-28, 9:28:56 AM] Shardul Bansal: but difficult
[2024-04-28, 9:29:13 AM] Abbey Desta: Yes. I have a lot of strategies around this. But still seeing if it’s worth going for.
[2024-04-28, 9:29:27 AM] Abbey Desta: Have the QuickBooks for self employed
[2024-04-28, 9:29:45 AM] Abbey Desta: Our version. Starting with Uber drivers and the like
[2024-04-28, 9:29:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: a one stop shop for me as a customer for all things finance? insurance/loans/personal etc?
[2024-04-28, 9:30:12 AM] Abbey Desta: Yes. But we become the gateway for both sides
[2024-04-28, 9:30:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: that would be huuuuge
[2024-04-28, 9:31:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: did you mom test to know that’s a real problem? just curious since im learning about the process rn at EF
‎[2024-04-28, 9:32:58 AM] Abbey Desta: ‎audio omitted
[2024-04-28, 9:34:13 AM] Abbey Desta: Not nearly enough
[2024-04-28, 9:34:21 AM] Abbey Desta: I’ve had a few conversations
[2024-04-28, 9:34:45 AM] Abbey Desta: But also read heaps over reviews on line about the experience users are having. It’s not great.
[2024-04-28, 9:35:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: its a good signal if people complain online because it means theyve prolly used the internet to try to find other solutions, couldnt and then went on reddit
[2024-04-28, 9:35:51 AM] Abbey Desta: Yeah good point
[2024-04-28, 9:36:13 AM] Abbey Desta: We think we could have a monopoly in this segment.
[2024-04-28, 9:36:20 AM] Abbey Desta: Uber drivers
[2024-04-28, 9:36:30 AM] Abbey Desta: It will be a safe space for us to build in
[2024-04-28, 9:36:43 AM] Abbey Desta: Customer service is also a big one.
[2024-04-28, 9:37:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: good solution to build the network effect, execution will be everything
[2024-04-28, 9:37:34 AM] Abbey Desta: Yeah. I will be looking for an engineer in q3
[2024-04-28, 9:37:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: dunno anyone building for uber drivers rn
[2024-04-28, 9:37:58 AM] Abbey Desta: Just finishing establishing this sales team for drivesmart
[2024-04-28, 9:38:07 AM] Shardul Bansal: niiice, remote?

[2024-04-28, 9:39:37 AM] Abbey Desta: Haha ok ok
[2024-04-28, 9:39:47 AM] Shardul Bansal: all of this, for me, the money, the power, the influence, engineering
[2024-04-28, 9:39:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: all for tennis
[2024-04-28, 9:39:49 AM] Abbey Desta: I’ll sign up to the Jericho of SF
[2024-04-28, 9:42:10 AM] Abbey Desta: A lot of the complaints about QuickBooks suggested they didn’t have the best engineering
[2024-04-28, 9:42:20 AM] Abbey Desta: I found that interesting
[2024-04-28, 9:42:30 AM] Abbey Desta: They have such a strong brand and distribution
[2024-04-28, 9:42:37 AM] Abbey Desta: But they don’t love their product
[2024-04-28, 9:42:46 AM] Abbey Desta: It seems like a good target
[2024-04-28, 9:47:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: Hmnnnn, the moat might be in the quality of what you produce
[2024-04-28, 9:47:47 AM] Abbey Desta: I think we will have to find ways to build a moat
‎[2024-04-28, 9:48:41 AM] Abbey Desta: ‎audio omitted
[2024-04-28, 9:50:18 AM] Abbey Desta: Time invested is also another defense
[2024-04-28, 9:50:22 AM] Shardul Bansal: but that’s an argument for quickbooks, right
[2024-04-28, 9:50:43 AM] Abbey Desta: When the user has spent time labeling expenses and so on
[2024-04-28, 9:50:47 AM] Abbey Desta: Correct
[2024-04-28, 9:50:48 AM] Shardul Bansal: id rather use what’s already out there, 2x, 3x isnt better enough to swtich
[2024-04-28, 9:50:56 AM] Abbey Desta: Exactly
[2024-04-28, 9:51:08 AM] Abbey Desta: Unless the pain is great enough
[2024-04-28, 9:51:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: which is what you’re expecting
[2024-04-28, 9:51:29 AM] Abbey Desta: But that’s why we build around a niche audience first
[2024-04-28, 9:51:55 AM] Abbey Desta: Not try to take the whole market
[2024-04-28, 9:52:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: right
[2024-04-28, 9:53:19 AM] Abbey Desta: If we build specifically for a segment we know deeply we can enter the market that way.
[2024-04-28, 9:54:00 AM] Abbey Desta: We get penetration there. From there we can then take on the bigger segments.
[2024-04-28, 9:54:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: that makes sense, classic 0 to 1
[2024-04-28, 9:55:02 AM] Abbey Desta: How about you?

[2024-04-28, 10:00:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: But removal aren’t
[2024-04-28, 10:00:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: The market is filled with avoidance credits, those should be illegal

[2024-04-28, 10:05:58 AM] Abbey Desta: Can you track carbon credits and provide a report/ badge that states the “real” carbon rating?
[2024-04-28, 10:06:28 AM] Abbey Desta: Like an equifax for carbon
[2024-04-28, 10:06:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: the problem is each marketplace does its own thing
[2024-04-28, 10:06:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: no centralised authority
[2024-04-28, 10:06:45 AM] Abbey Desta: Equifax is a credit reporting agency

[2024-07-05, 2:40:14 PM] Abbey Desta: operatoins
[2024-07-05, 2:40:36 PM] Abbey Desta: but 10% fee to our supervising accountant. I think 20 aud
[2024-07-05, 2:40:44 PM] Abbey Desta: and then the operations team
[2024-07-05, 2:40:54 PM] Abbey Desta: which is is not much
[2024-07-05, 2:41:07 PM] Abbey Desta: a few thousand a month, two of them in the asia
[2024-07-05, 2:41:17 PM] Abbey Desta: but they could do 100s a month

[2024-07-05, 2:43:12 PM] Abbey Desta: I think 99 owuld be amazing
[2024-07-05, 2:43:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: agreed
[2024-07-05, 2:43:36 PM] Abbey Desta: but we would need to be doing a lot of volume, and it would be good to get them onto a saas product

[2024-07-05, 2:43:50 PM] Abbey Desta: 12 a month or something

[2024-08-31, 10:52:57 AM] Abbey Desta: I’m trying to think of a name for the company
[2024-08-31, 10:53:16 AM] Abbey Desta: what do you think of “Limpio”?
[2024-08-31, 2:11:36 PM] Shardul Bansal: Sounds like limpdick
[2024-08-31, 2:11:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: Too much “limp”
[2024-08-31, 2:12:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: Limio could be good tho?
[2024-08-31, 2:12:12 PM] Abbey Desta: Hahahah I was worried about it sounding limpish. You’re right
[2024-08-31, 2:12:18 PM] Abbey Desta: Exactly

[2024-08-31, 2:14:32 PM] Abbey Desta: “Neat”
[2024-08-31, 2:14:48 PM] Abbey Desta: I don’t like “align”
[2024-08-31, 2:14:56 PM] Abbey Desta: Because it doesn’t roll off the tongue
[2024-08-31, 2:15:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: Neat?
[2024-08-31, 2:15:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: seo would be difficult there, no?
[2024-08-31, 2:15:54 PM] Abbey Desta: True
[2024-08-31, 2:16:06 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also domains would be super $$$ for just 4 letters
[2024-08-31, 2:16:06 PM] Abbey Desta: But I don’t really worry about seo
[2024-08-31, 2:16:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, fair
[2024-08-31, 2:16:20 PM] Abbey Desta: There are other versions available
[2024-08-31, 2:16:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: Most likely not gonna drive any traffic through seo
[2024-08-31, 2:16:35 PM] Abbey Desta: That’s not the issue. More so the name
[2024-08-31, 2:16:44 PM] Abbey Desta: Just trying to think of a name

[2024-08-31, 4:43:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: You should ask ChatGPT for variations on those
[2024-08-31, 5:15:53 PM] Abbey Desta: Yes. I asked ChatGPT but the names were all very generic. TradeFlux, tradezen
[2024-08-31, 5:16:02 PM] Abbey Desta: AlephTrade I like
[2024-08-31, 5:16:09 PM] Abbey Desta: Landed too

[2024-09-03, 11:24:56 AM] Abbey Desta: why that over Align
[2024-09-03, 11:25:08 AM] Abbey Desta: why?
[2024-09-03, 11:25:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: Who was a god-tier trader in the early-middle ages...
[2024-09-03, 11:25:43 AM] Abbey Desta: haha
[2024-09-03, 11:25:57 AM] Abbey Desta: sounds high signal
[2024-09-03, 11:26:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: EXACTLY

[2024-09-03, 11:26:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: https://www.google.com/search?q=Francis+Drake&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

but Francis would be cool
[2024-09-03, 11:26:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: I like align, it's simple
[2024-09-03, 11:27:05 AM] Shardul Bansal: I like align more than AlephTrade
[2024-09-03, 11:27:14 AM] Abbey Desta: me too
[2024-09-03, 11:27:24 AM] Abbey Desta: aligntrade.io
[2024-09-03, 11:27:32 AM] Abbey Desta: we can get Align when we have more money
[2024-09-03, 11:28:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: that's pretty good
[2024-09-03, 11:28:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: but what does align mean
[2024-09-03, 11:28:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: or is it meaningless in its name
[2024-09-03, 11:28:39 AM] Abbey Desta: align, alignment
[2024-09-03, 11:28:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: alignment in AI is specifically about morals and ethics FYI
[2024-09-03, 11:29:00 AM] Abbey Desta: we are getting things into alignment before they enter the supply chain
[2024-09-03, 11:29:06 AM] Abbey Desta: no no
[2024-09-03, 11:29:08 AM] Abbey Desta: not about morals
[2024-09-03, 11:29:13 AM] Shardul Bansal: AI alignment - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment

[2024-09-03, 11:29:40 AM] Shardul Bansal: hmnnn, ok, that makes sense
[2024-09-03, 11:30:14 AM] Shardul Bansal: Align can also have the same naming thesis as Apple, which I believe was meaningless to jobs
[2024-09-03, 11:30:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: but that's also fine
[2024-09-03, 11:30:28 AM] Shardul Bansal: it doesn't HAVE to mean anything
[2024-09-03, 11:30:33 AM] Abbey Desta: yes

[2024-09-03, 11:31:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: makes sense, aligntrade is good
[2024-09-03, 11:31:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: just for the domain for now
[2024-09-03, 11:31:26 AM] Abbey Desta: i had alignedtrade before

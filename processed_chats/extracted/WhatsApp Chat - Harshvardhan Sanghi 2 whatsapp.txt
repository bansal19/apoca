[2024-02-01, 2:25:45 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Any decisions on what is next with EF and startups?
[2024-02-01, 2:26:12 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Very curious to hear how things are panning
[2024-02-02, 7:30:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea man, been in touch with Simon pastor, thanks for the intro! Just working on honing down the problem right now, just exploring and reading about some industries rn
[2024-02-02, 8:02:01 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: That’s awesome man
[2024-02-02, 8:02:10 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: What are you honing in on
[2024-02-02, 8:02:19 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Are you planning to go back to your job?
[2024-02-02, 8:34:59 AM] Shardul Bansal: honing in on dMRV for carbon sequestration, figuring out if there’s a gap in the industry for automated monitoring
[2024-02-02, 8:35:13 AM] Shardul Bansal: Nahhh, really wasnt happy at AWS
[2024-02-02, 8:35:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: What about you, how’s DSV going? You doing EF this summer?
[2024-02-04, 11:29:47 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: That’s an interesting but crowded space
[2024-02-04, 11:29:53 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: So lots to do for sure
[2024-02-04, 11:30:02 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Makes sense
[2024-02-04, 11:30:08 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Congrats on making the jump Duden
[2024-02-04, 11:30:18 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: EF I’m not sure yet
[2024-02-04, 11:30:21 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Are you doing it?
[2024-02-05, 7:23:45 AM] Shardul Bansal: Im following up with Simon pastor, let’s see. If i have an idea or a solid cofounder, prolly not
[2024-02-05, 7:24:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: Do you know much about it? Would be keen to talk to know more
[2024-02-05, 9:09:58 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Makes sense
[2024-02-05, 9:10:06 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: I’d love to hear how you are thinking about EF
[2024-02-05, 9:11:33 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: I don’t know too much, more of a consultant view but I’ll say I’ve noticed a few things - 
1. Each form of sequestration need it’s own mrv, especially removal 
2. ⁠carbon removal companies that do projects already are building mrv platforms 
3. ⁠it is a tough space to be in cause slim margins and (to me seems like a lot of people)
[2024-02-05, 9:11:46 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: But I have never looked deep so I could be totally working
[2024-02-05, 9:11:52 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Wrong*
[2024-02-06, 7:06:43 AM] Shardul Bansal: Sweet, thanks man, that makes sense. Lets hop on a call sometime this week if you’ve got some time? I wanna know more about what you think of the space
[2024-02-06, 6:23:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: There's a company, ikigai carbon, here in Vancouver that's actually doing methane emissions monitoring
[2024-02-06, 6:23:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: not as looked into but each tonne of methane translates to 28 carbon credits (depending on type)
[2024-02-06, 6:24:05 PM] Shardul Bansal: So more focussed on that
[2024-03-02, 2:10:21 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Hey man
[2024-03-02, 2:10:32 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: I’m so so sorry for the late responses
[2024-03-02, 2:10:35 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Crazy few weeks
[2024-03-02, 2:10:59 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: I was at the EF office in London and they mentioned you might join?
[2024-03-02, 2:11:05 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: I’m down to have a chat this weekend or next week whenever better
[2024-03-02, 2:11:13 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Operating in US Easter time so that’s also better
[2024-03-03, 8:21:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: yeeeeeye I had a call with Nick Sopuch last week, there's a possibility I might do the SF cohort, but still got one more interview left
[2024-03-03, 8:21:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: nice, you're back in the US! that's sick
[2024-03-04, 5:08:10 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Ahh nice!! Sf cohort sounds very fun

[2024-03-31, 10:37:30 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: What’s the final word on EF
[2024-03-31, 10:37:33 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: You doing it?
[2024-04-01, 9:04:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: dude i'm still tryna make SF work but might send it to London this week if that doesn't work ahahah

[2024-04-01, 9:05:02 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: It was nice
[2024-04-01, 10:24:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: just selection summit, competition is tough but likely sending it to London by the weekend
[2024-04-01, 11:33:48 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Haha I’m confused
[2024-04-01, 11:33:52 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: What does that mean
[2024-04-01, 8:18:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: competition was tough for SF, so London makes the most sense!
[2024-04-02, 5:05:06 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Makes sense
[2024-04-02, 5:05:18 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Do you think sf has a better talent pool though
[2024-04-02, 7:35:12 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yes, I do. Haven’t talked to the London cohort but SF folks were cracked
[2024-04-02, 7:38:06 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Hahah nice
[2024-04-02, 7:38:07 AM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: That’s good

gas prices in nearly every US state are at least 4-5 times cheaper than electricity. I just don't think it makes sense to install a heat pump in most places economically rn

[2025-02-12, 9:04:36 PM] Harshvardhan Sanghi: Also bro we will have to phrase this a few ways, some thoughts. I reckon this is chill but want to like give you the heads up
1. We might have to Call it entrepreneur first fellowship or something. there is an issue of this happening at the same time as DSV so might have to be flexible on how we work it out
2. this is for the MS portion (but its like a baby MS that really values entrepreneurship more than academics) so you will have to speak to my technical provide. I would claim I showed you some glimpses when we worked together but we might have to go project forward a bit. For me they want to know I can build stuff and mck has not ruined me basically

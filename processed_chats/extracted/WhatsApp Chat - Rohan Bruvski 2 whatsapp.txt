But very soon, we’ll all be together to enjoy and celebrate all these special occasions as a family. I hope you’re able to celebrate with the rest of the GLT. In order to fully celebrate this one, I thought it would be best to gift you something that can allow you to build on your hobby: efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. Be able to tell the time better, be able to tell the weather better, be on top of the number of steps you’ve taken, monitor your sleep, send us texts, and do a whole lot more with the Apple Watch Series 7! Love you tonnes Daddy and I hope you have an absolutely wonderful day, I’ll see you soon!

[2021-11-01, 4:18:29 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Hi Dad,
Just wanted to write to you a small letter for your birthday!
I hope you know how blessed I feel to have you in my life! I’m super proud to be your son.
Especially how supportive you are of me and as I have gotten older I have been able to use your support and guidance to help me in so many ways. Like giving me advice on how to deal with situations at work and I really cherish these moments and being able to learn from you. 
And I am amazed by how strong you have been able to be for Mom, I know how tough it is for the both of you. You put on a brave exterior but deep down are anxious too but if anyone can make it work then its you and mom!

Happy Birthday and love you loads Dad!

PS  I may not always admit it some of your Dad jokes are just a teensie bit really funny

[2021-11-05, 8:08:42 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Awesome
[2021-11-05, 8:08:53 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I'll wait for your confirmation first
[2021-11-05, 8:08:56 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And then book tickets
[2021-11-05, 8:09:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yesssss, sure thing
[2021-11-05, 8:09:13 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Fuck how sick would it be to watch the title decider Live
[2021-11-05, 8:10:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: Dude it would be insane
[2021-11-05, 8:10:45 AM] Shardul Bansal: So sick
[2021-11-05, 8:13:01 AM] Rohan Bruvski: What do you reckon though
[2021-11-05, 8:13:06 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Will your boss say yes?
[2021-11-05, 8:13:17 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Seeing how nobody is even coming to the office atm
[2021-11-05, 8:14:32 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m honestly not sure, the issue is that I don’t have too many work from abroad days left, I think I originally had 10 and I’ve used 8 of those for Strasbourg
[2021-11-05, 8:14:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: So most of it would need to be holiday
[2021-11-05, 8:14:58 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Ah fuck
[2021-11-05, 8:15:07 AM] Rohan Bruvski: But do you have tell him you're going abroad?
[2021-11-05, 8:15:21 AM] Rohan Bruvski: You can't just say you'll move to Toronto for a month or something
[2021-11-05, 8:15:43 AM] Shardul Bansal: Well yea, if I’m working, then he’ll know by looking at what timezone
[2021-11-05, 8:15:50 AM] Shardul Bansal: I don’t wanna lie, it’s not right
[2021-11-05, 8:16:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: He’ll figure it out if I log on at odd hours and get shit done at weird times
[2021-11-05, 8:16:19 AM] Rohan Bruvski: True
[2021-11-05, 8:16:33 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Fucking Internet logs don't help with that at all
[2021-11-05, 8:16:45 AM] Rohan Bruvski: But did your work suffer a lot when you were in Strasbourg
[2021-11-05, 8:17:02 AM] Shardul Bansal: Not at all, was perfectly fine actually
[2021-11-05, 8:17:23 AM] Shardul Bansal: Some days were slow, yea, but that happens here as well
[2021-11-05, 8:21:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Okay that's good
[2021-11-05, 8:21:44 AM] Rohan Bruvski: So he knows he can trust you to get shit done from abroad
[2021-11-05, 8:22:02 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Plus tell him it's mum's 50th or something
[2021-11-05, 8:37:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: That’s a good idea 👍
[2021-11-07, 10:03:16 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey man

[2021-11-08, 11:04:23 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah sure man!

[2021-11-09, 9:08:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: This is what my manager said
[2021-11-09, 9:08:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: “it is likely that it is possible to work those extra couple of days, but we’ll need to file an exception for that. and then it will be a question whether it’s worth taking the exception route for a few days”
[2021-11-09, 9:08:54 AM] Rohan Bruvski: What does that mean
[2021-11-09, 9:09:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: So will they take the exception route
[2021-11-09, 9:09:18 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And get it approved
[2021-11-09, 9:10:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: Most likely mykhailo will just be like “doesn’t matter, yea, work from Dubai”, we don’t need to file an exception
[2021-11-09, 9:10:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Okay
[2021-11-09, 9:10:30 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Do you want to talk to your manager about it
[2021-11-09, 9:10:34 AM] Rohan Bruvski: To get clarity

[2021-11-09, 3:10:14 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Happy Birthday Mom!

Everyday I am grateful to have you in my life as you’re more than just a mother to me. You’re my rock, my support, my problem solver, best friend and confidante all rolled into one! I could honestly not have asked for anything more from the world’s best mom and friend! 

And I am incredibly proud of you and what you’ve achieved especially with the roller coaster of a year you’ve had. From starting a new business to navigating a move at the same time while helping us all with all our problems. 

Today is the day when I promise not to cause any of the trouble that I caused you the rest of the year. Enjoy a peaceful birthday since you never know what I might do tomorrow. Just kidding. You’re amazing! I’ll be good, for today anyways I promise.

Oh and as always Mom, Maple Syrup to The Superwoman in the Bansal’s life ❤️

[2022-08-26, 8:50:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: It’s tough but she took it alright, I blamed it on Mykhailo and him needing me for a project in October
[2022-08-26, 8:51:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: Kinda lied, but it needed to be said 😔😞
[2022-08-26, 8:51:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: Now you gotta pull that band aid off as well

[2022-09-22, 8:04:27 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite aite
[2022-09-22, 8:04:36 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Maybe I call you tn depending on how things are!
[2022-09-24, 10:17:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll call you tomorrow in the afternoon around 4 pm??
[2022-09-25, 1:49:07 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite sounds good man!
[2022-09-27, 4:05:28 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey man
[2022-09-27, 4:05:35 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Do you know a guy called Hugh Lam
[2022-09-27, 4:05:53 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Working at Jive bee products?
[2022-09-27, 8:19:09 AM] Shardul Bansal: Nope, never heard of em, why?
[2022-09-27, 8:38:53 AM] Rohan Bruvski: He's checked my LinkedIn thrice this week
[2022-09-27, 8:39:00 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And lives in Vancouver
[2022-09-27, 8:39:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: So thought you'd know him
[2022-09-27, 8:40:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yup just checked him out on LinkedIn, have never heard of him
[2022-09-27, 8:40:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite nvm then
[2022-09-27, 8:40:41 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Btw the coin you mining
[2022-09-27, 8:40:50 AM] Rohan Bruvski: You think it's worth putting some money into?
[2022-09-27, 8:41:07 AM] Shardul Bansal: Can’t really dooo that
[2022-09-27, 8:41:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: It’s not supposed to be traded I don’t think,
[2022-09-27, 8:42:10 AM] Shardul Bansal: The primary use is incentive to train large scale models, so if you want the coin, you have to set up an instance that trains the models on the network
[2022-09-27, 8:42:38 AM] Shardul Bansal: But…they did have people technically buy some stake in the coin
[2022-09-27, 8:43:00 AM] Shardul Bansal: I don’t know if it’s worth “buying the coin”
[2022-09-27, 8:43:42 AM] Shardul Bansal: I spent some time this weekend setting up a miner using CPUs available on AWS, I couldn’t get it to work but once I do, I can also set one up for you
[2022-09-27, 8:47:57 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Ah that would be fucking awesome
[2022-09-27, 8:48:07 AM] Rohan Bruvski: What's the cost of setting up a miner?
[2022-09-27, 8:48:21 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Cuz I'm looking to diversify from just stocks atm
[2022-09-27, 8:49:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: With the instance I’ve chosen, likely $60 a month. I can gauge how much Tao I’m able to obtain in a week of the miner being set up, and then see if it’s fruitful
[2022-09-27, 9:16:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Okay that would be awesome
[2022-09-27, 9:16:31 AM] Rohan Bruvski: If you're making a net profit I'll start sending you 60 bucks a month too!
[2022-10-05, 8:27:23 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Nice try starting a convo with her
[2022-10-05, 8:27:40 AM] Rohan Bruvski: If only her responses weren't so bloody dry 😂
[2022-10-05, 8:27:43 AM] Shardul Bansal: 🤷‍♂️
[2022-10-05, 8:27:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: I tried ahahaha
[2022-10-05, 8:27:59 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Definitely
[2022-10-05, 8:28:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: You ask omkar jiya about his fam
[2022-10-05, 8:28:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Didn't even do the classic what about you
[2022-10-05, 8:28:13 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Nah fam
[2022-10-05, 8:28:28 AM] Rohan Bruvski: If I wanted to experience dryness would just go to the desert
[2022-10-05, 8:28:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: Well, she can’t ask me about our fam, they’re right there
[2022-10-05, 8:29:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: She coulda tried still
[2022-10-05, 10:48:25 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey man
[2022-10-05, 10:48:48 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Is it possible for you to send me any finance openings Amazon may have in France?
[2022-10-05, 10:48:56 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Or like the website where I csn check this
[2022-10-06, 10:01:15 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh yea for sure
[2022-10-06, 10:01:20 AM] Shardul Bansal: Why didn’t I get these messages
[2022-10-06, 10:01:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll send any that I see this weekend
[2022-10-06, 10:02:15 AM] Shardul Bansal: Or before, should have some time today
[2022-10-06, 7:46:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: So in Paris there’s 26 job postings related to “Finance” and this one looks the most interesting and up your alley: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/2219074/senior-finance-analyst-amazon-logistics
[2022-10-06, 7:47:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: They recommend for applications and referrals to only apply to one, because once you’re in the system you might bounce around depending on your skills/xp
[2022-10-06, 7:48:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: There’s also this one https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/2239133/snr-finance-analyst-prime-video-prime-video-france but I seriously doubt you wanna move to Clichy??
[2022-10-06, 7:51:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: Last one that looks interesting (in Paris): https://amazon.jobs/en/internal/jobs/2203381/risk-manager-financial-reviews
[2022-10-06, 11:19:36 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Oh man thanks for sharing the jobs!
[2022-10-06, 11:20:24 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Finance analyst one looks the best and why not clichy is like on the suburbs of Paris
[2022-10-06, 11:20:41 PM] Rohan Bruvski: So you'd say for me to pick one and only apply to a single place?
[2022-10-07, 8:53:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh I thought it was a different city
[2022-10-07, 8:54:01 AM] Shardul Bansal: Niiice, the one for prime video looks good but they require 5+ years of experience
[2022-10-07, 8:55:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: The other one is for Amazon logistics…which isn’t gonna be as interesting as prime video but it could be cool 🤷‍♂️
[2022-10-07, 8:56:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: If you send me your most up-to-date resume and address in Paris (35 Boulevard Malesherbes I think…?) I can put in the referral today.
[2022-10-07, 10:55:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Wait so which one were you gonna put the referral for man?
‎[2022-10-07, 10:55:31 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Rohan Bansal Resume .pdf • ‎1 page ‎document omitted
[2022-10-07, 10:55:59 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I've attached my resume and my address is 37 Boulevard Malesherbes  75008 Paris
[2022-10-07, 11:17:11 AM] Shardul Bansal: This one
[2022-10-07, 11:17:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: Your xp seems most suited for this, what do you think?
[2022-10-07, 11:27:37 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yep you're right I have the best fit for this one
[2022-10-07, 11:28:10 AM] Rohan Bruvski: If you can add anywhere it woild be great if you say that at my previous role we invested into two last mile logistics companies
[2022-10-07, 11:28:30 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And i understand the pain points challenges and KPIs of the sector
[2022-10-07, 11:51:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ok, perfect, in the jobs portal internally, I also see the hiring manager so I can reach out to them to convey that information
[2022-10-11, 7:22:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Thanks a lot man
[2022-10-11, 7:22:16 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Did you hear back from the hiring manager btw
[2022-10-11, 7:22:22 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Or do you need something from my side?
[2022-10-11, 10:54:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: Nothing yet, you’ll first receive an email from Amazon saying you should fill out an application! don’t need anything from your side 👍
[2022-10-11, 2:28:22 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Beauty! Appreciate this man can't wait for the email from Amazon
[2022-10-11, 7:38:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: So, if possible, I also want to mention some _results_ for the hiring manager that they can look at. I like your resume but I think in your FirstBridge venture’s opportunity, there’s **impact** missing I think. Like “proactively identified potential investment opportunities leading to x investment return in company”
[2022-10-11, 7:39:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ve already put the referral in, but if you can give me a couple sentences of the impact, I can forward that as well to the hiring manager
[2022-10-11, 11:51:21 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Damn didn't realise I was working with a career counsellor
[2022-10-11, 11:51:50 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Tbh I had started editing my cv and changing certain things should hopefully have a new one tn
[2022-10-11, 11:52:19 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite I'll think of some impact sentences and send to you!
[2022-10-12, 11:50:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ahahaha dude you taught me that when you looked at MY resume
[2022-10-13, 2:22:37 PM] Rohan Bruvski: ‎Missed voice call
[2022-10-13, 2:22:41 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Shalom dawg
[2022-10-13, 2:22:44 PM] Rohan Bruvski: You free now?
[2022-10-13, 10:37:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ahhh shalom shalom I’d gone back to work, I’ll try to catch you sometime next week!
[2022-10-14, 10:25:11 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite lmk which day! Let's discuss our dubai plans next week!
[2022-10-23, 2:52:23 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Yo dawg just going to bed now
[2022-10-23, 2:52:28 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Let's go workout tomorrow at 10?
[2022-10-23, 8:19:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: Let’s do it 👌
[2022-10-25, 12:41:05 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ayyy
[2022-11-02, 1:14:58 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey dude
[2022-11-02, 1:15:06 PM] Rohan Bruvski: How's it going in Krabi
[2022-11-02, 1:15:34 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Btw we should figure out what to get mum soon no
[2022-11-02, 6:08:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: It’s liiiiit, did some snorkeling yesterday and got some sick drone shots
[2022-11-02, 6:09:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: We should definitely figure that out. I was at the airport and I saw this massage gun which was sick and could help her out with her leg but it’s not an A+ idea
[2022-11-02, 6:10:09 PM] Shardul Bansal: I also feel bad we didn’t get dad anything, I’m thinking the Apple Watch is what we tried getting him last year?
[2022-11-03, 3:58:54 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Damn I'm jealous dawg
[2022-11-03, 4:00:12 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Oooh that's not a bad shout something related to massaging could work
[2022-11-03, 4:00:42 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I also saw a heart shaped jigsaw puzzle with a photo we choose?
[2022-11-03, 4:00:59 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah but he honestly doesn't care, spoke to him about it yesterday
[2022-11-03, 4:39:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea I’m not sure about the whole sentimental gift vs material gift, I think she’s really after a proper proper gift this time round?
[2022-11-03, 4:39:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: The only thing with this massage gun, which is likely really good for her legs and muscles long term, is that it kind of looks like a vibrator 🙃
[2022-11-05, 1:00:06 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah i get that feeling too
[2022-11-05, 1:00:16 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Could have done without that image tbh..
[2022-11-05, 1:00:51 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Actually the massage gun is a good idea! Should I buy it from Amazon and send to her in Dubai?
[2022-11-05, 6:03:41 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea let’s do it, I can also order it and send it to her if you’d like

[2022-11-09, 6:12:42 PM] Shardul Bansal: Udit Narayan is performing on the 12th of Nov in Dubai, pretty close to mom and dad. How’s about we get them 2 tickets to that concert?

[2022-11-09, 10:25:24 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Normally I'd say go for it
[2022-11-09, 10:25:49 PM] Rohan Bruvski: But maybe we should ask Dad to know if Mum really likes or knows Udit Narayan first?
[2022-11-10, 8:01:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: Good idea
[2022-11-10, 8:01:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’ll ask
[2022-11-27, 3:31:59 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey man
[2022-11-27, 3:32:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Mum kinda had an anxiety attack this morning and she said she wasn't able to talk to you properly this week
[2022-11-27, 3:32:50 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Could you call her and talk to her a for a bit when you get up?
[2022-11-27, 6:35:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: Did she have the anxiety attack because I didn’t call…?
[2022-11-27, 6:36:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, I’ll definitely give her a call today
[2022-11-27, 6:38:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: But sometimes, imma have busy weeks. Was in SFO earlier this week, then I’ve been oncall for the team which has been kinda stressful. But at the same time I see that she really probably needed us this week since Dad left and those weeks are always tough 😔
[2022-11-27, 7:10:51 AM] Rohan Bruvski: She tried calling you this morning and when you didn't pick up she felt like shit and just started crying
[2022-11-27, 7:11:07 AM] Rohan Bruvski: It's less to do with you and more she's lonely and without dad
[2022-11-27, 7:11:43 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah exactly I told her you have a busy schedule too and she got thst but I think she's kinda sensitive atm and needs us a bit more
[2022-11-27, 9:10:47 AM] Shardul Bansal: She didn’t even call me yesterday! I don’t see any missed calls
[2022-11-27, 9:11:21 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, I’m trying to call her now but now she seems angry with me
[2022-12-03, 5:07:24 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey Shardul you'll be having Dad for secret Santa this year

[2023-01-15, 12:01:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: Bhaiya I have a favour to ask, you have full access to Crunchbase, right? Can you look up Bittensor, the Toronto based startup for me to see how much they raised in their series A?

[2023-01-15, 1:25:27 PM] Shardul Bansal: hmnnnn is that odd or does that happen from time to time
[2023-01-15, 1:47:05 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Happens
[2023-01-15, 1:47:24 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Normally means it was a small raise
[2023-01-15, 1:47:34 PM] Rohan Bruvski: And not covered by any major investors
[2023-01-15, 6:30:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok ok cool good to know thank you 🙏

[2023-04-17, 8:40:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Might make more sense to start a day later no?
[2023-04-17, 9:01:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: Well yea, but then it’s already Saturday, will we be able to do Club Med for 3 days in that case?
[2023-04-17, 9:02:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: But if you can take Monday off or something, then I’m all for starting on the 10th instead
[2023-04-17, 9:57:16 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I'll take Monday/Tue off then
[2023-04-17, 9:57:50 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Would be better to really enjoy thr facilities over a few days

[2023-06-08, 12:14:45 AM] Shardul Bansal: Duuuuude I have no clue, will try to think it over on the trip 🫡🤷‍♂️
[2023-06-08, 2:50:45 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Might be too late no? Could be better to buy something this week itself
[2023-06-08, 7:01:36 AM] Shardul Bansal: The trip I mean my flight
[2023-06-08, 7:02:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: I’m also thinking about going hot air ballooning with them when we get there on Saturday the 18th?

[2023-06-08, 10:20:19 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Not a bad shout
[2023-06-08, 10:20:20 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Don't you think we should get something for the day itself?
[2023-06-08, 10:33:17 AM] Shardul Bansal: Maybe both is a good idea, tis the 30th and whatnot…
[2023-06-08, 10:33:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: I can look into booking Hot Air Ballooning in Paris 👀
[2023-06-08, 10:33:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: Or a similar activity
[2023-06-08, 10:35:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: Maybe we go with some nice jewelry for mum and accessory, like a watch for Dad? Is that too much?
[2023-06-08, 10:36:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, the new Apple Watch could be a shout, I think I can pick it up in Toronto before coming to Paris.

[2023-12-16, 6:23:27 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea, sinner, and alcaraz also notably not there but stacked lineup besides that
[2023-12-16, 6:23:41 AM] Shardul Bansal: Whole thing cost 200 AED total, so cheap
[2023-12-16, 6:37:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Get the feeling alacaraz won't be coming anytime soon
[2023-12-16, 6:37:13 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Guy is motivated by winning and not money
[2023-12-16, 6:37:22 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Fuck me so it's a loss making thing for them..
[2023-12-20, 9:24:55 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yoyoooo bhaiya can you pack your drone for the Thailand trip?
[2023-12-20, 10:45:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah sure good idea!
[2023-12-20, 10:45:26 AM] Rohan Bruvski: But can I take it with me in cabin baggage though?
[2023-12-20, 10:45:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Cuz I don't have any check in suitcase
[2023-12-20, 10:45:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: I think yes, that should be fine, or is it banned to travel with even?
[2023-12-20, 10:46:18 AM] Shardul Bansal: They do a scan here at the airport as well, don't they, of cabin baggage after immigration and before customs..
[2023-12-20, 10:46:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: is there a chance it's gonna get confiscated?
[2023-12-20, 10:46:48 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Idk if I can take it with me in cabin baggage
[2023-12-20, 10:47:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Cuz there's a risk of confiscation I feel
[2023-12-20, 10:47:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Can you check into this if possible?
[2023-12-20, 10:47:57 AM] Shardul Bansal: sure, will let you know
[2023-12-20, 10:51:59 AM] Shardul Bansal: It looks like if you don't have a GCAA license, customs will store it for you at the airport and you can collect it again after you leave Dubai. We can't obtain a license because we need to be residents. Might not be worth the risk :/
[2023-12-20, 11:46:11 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite fuck it that doesn't make sense then
[2023-12-20, 11:46:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Cuz we won't really be able to use it if it's impounded..
[2023-12-20, 11:51:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: Custom’s won’t impound it, they’ll ask you keep it storage and you can retrieve when you leave dubai
[2023-12-20, 1:03:10 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Ah so I can technically keep it wherever I want then?
[2023-12-20, 1:03:17 PM] Rohan Bruvski: They won't keep it for themselves
[2023-12-21, 4:09:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: The storage will be in the airport, but yeah, you won’t lose it
[2023-12-21, 4:09:34 AM] Shardul Bansal: Up to you if you wanna risk it, we could get some noice shots in Thailand
[2023-12-21, 4:10:01 AM] Shardul Bansal: Also, what the fuck kendall took his opportunity at the end of season 2 that was fucking nuts
[2023-12-21, 4:10:28 AM] Shardul Bansal: But he couldnt do it, again, didnt get the kill
[2023-12-21, 5:44:37 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I don’t mind bringing it but is there a point if they confiscate it at the airport?
[2023-12-21, 5:45:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Plus with it being in my check in, think French border control could make a big pain in the ass..
[2023-12-21, 5:45:23 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Ahahahah yeah man finally stepped outta his dad’s shadow and got a cheeky grin from Logan
[2023-12-21, 5:45:29 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Where are you currently?
[2023-12-21, 9:53:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: Just popped into season 4 👀👀👀

[2024-04-10, 2:14:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: sweat off the jetlag

[2024-06-05, 8:07:49 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yessir copped some seats cuz of work
[2024-06-05, 8:07:57 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Man she looked stunning in person 🔥
[2024-06-05, 8:08:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Btw How's it going with EF?
[2024-06-05, 8:38:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: oh wowwwww ok, so you're keeping the tradition alive of going to RG eh
[2024-06-05, 8:38:13 AM] Shardul Bansal: no way that's sick
[2024-06-05, 8:39:05 AM] Shardul Bansal: EF is solid, sticking with my cofounder Harsh, we're going to SF next week and gonna stay there a month just to breathe in that billion dollar air
[2024-06-05, 9:28:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Oooh no way! Did you guys pass the IC or going there to meet investors and get inspo?
[2024-06-05, 9:28:27 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Ahahah yep was super last minute but I'll take center court seats
[2024-06-05, 9:31:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: haven't passed IC and tbh at the rate we're going, might not happen but yea, just feel like we'll get more done in that environment
[2024-06-05, 9:32:03 AM] Shardul Bansal: how're you? How's work? Solid anniversary with Zrinka?
[2024-06-05, 9:59:15 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Is it not worth passing IC and getting funding first?
[2024-06-05, 9:59:51 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah good anniversary with Zrinka did a picnic and VR museum thing! How are you doing these days? Crazy with the startup or
[2024-06-05, 11:09:19 AM] Shardul Bansal: Definitely, but we’ll be closer to doing that from SF instead of here
[2024-06-05, 11:09:37 AM] Shardul Bansal: Niiiice! That’s really cute honestly
[2024-06-05, 11:10:01 AM] Shardul Bansal: Yea startup has me balls deep in work, but just slightly sick after coming back from Zurich
[2024-06-05, 11:10:40 AM] Shardul Bansal: Took the fact that I was slightly sick as a small liberty to vegetate for a day yesterday, literally did nothing except chill on my phone and watch BS
[2024-06-05, 11:11:28 AM] Shardul Bansal: idk why i do it, it's not like I feel rested after it. Honestly the best rest is to be balls deep inside someone but haven't looked hard to find that person ya know
[2024-06-05, 11:11:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: balls deep at work --> balls deep at home --> night of rest, rinse, repeat
[2024-06-05, 11:11:55 AM] Shardul Bansal: ^ ideal lifestyle
[2024-06-05, 4:27:42 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Really? Higher acceptance rate and funding in SF?
[2024-06-05, 4:28:33 PM] Rohan Bruvski: These balls were resting deep inside your chin 🤪 sorry couldn't help myself was staring in me in the face
[2024-06-05, 4:28:52 PM] Rohan Bruvski: That's deep dawg, so deep
[2024-06-05, 4:31:05 PM] Rohan Bruvski: That really is the way to go but tough to do thst when you're on the grind since finding the right partner to be "balls deep at home" is a lot of work in itself.. Talking to any chicks there?
[2024-06-06, 3:45:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: we’ll just be closer to our customers there
[2024-06-06, 3:46:37 AM] Shardul Bansal: Nahhhh talking to girls is a time consuming process as you said
[2024-06-06, 3:46:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: can’t really focus on it
[2024-06-06, 5:42:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I thought the solution was for EU cuz of regulation or?
[2024-06-06, 5:42:20 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Man dating and planning everything is another job in itself
[2024-06-06, 5:42:40 AM] Rohan Bruvski: IF it happens organically great if not just gotta use the good ol hand till then
[2024-06-06, 2:52:26 PM] Shardul Bansal: nahhh we scrapped that heat pump bullshit
[2024-06-06, 2:52:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: invalidated the idea and thank god for that
[2024-06-06, 2:53:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea absolutely
[2024-06-06, 3:04:22 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Damn here I thought you were gonna be the king of pumping..

[2024-06-11, 9:35:09 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Guy is filthy rich and connected and also thinking of creating something of his own
[2024-06-11, 9:35:20 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Could be worth having a coffee with him, should I connect you with him?
[2024-06-11, 10:36:56 AM] Shardul Bansal: That sounds perfect, yessss, a warm introduction with him would be amazing

[2024-06-13, 1:02:13 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Nice guess it must be sweet to constantly bounce ideas off one another
[2024-06-14, 7:36:06 AM] Shardul Bansal: duuuude no, we're just serving a bit of a bullshit pie to EF rn
[2024-06-14, 8:45:07 AM] Shardul Bansal: Also btw did you plan anything for mom and dads anniversary

[2024-06-14, 8:58:39 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I had an idea of getting some really fancy nice tea, cuz both mum and dad
[2024-06-14, 8:58:42 AM] Rohan Bruvski: love it
[2024-06-14, 8:58:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: why aren’t you doing well, what happened?
[2024-06-14, 8:59:00 AM] Shardul Bansal: that’s a good idea
[2024-06-14, 8:59:16 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Just work, no support and just overall cuntiness of people
[2024-06-14, 8:59:24 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Aite if you’re down
[2024-06-14, 8:59:30 AM] Shardul Bansal: oh fuck that cuntiness
[2024-06-14, 8:59:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: I can go to Galeries Lafayette this weekend
[2024-06-14, 8:59:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: it’s such ass
[2024-06-14, 8:59:42 AM] Rohan Bruvski: and get a few nice tea boxes and have them wrapped?
[2024-06-14, 8:59:53 AM] Shardul Bansal: have you thought about taking a month off?
[2024-06-14, 9:00:01 AM] Shardul Bansal: Smart
[2024-06-14, 9:00:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: The whole team is a cunt and I am tired of having to self motivate
[2024-06-14, 9:00:19 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Seriously considering going to a doctor getting a burnout prescrip
[2024-06-14, 9:00:27 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And fucking off to Berlin to be with Zrinka
[2024-06-14, 9:00:31 AM] Shardul Bansal: that’s actually not a bad idea
[2024-06-14, 9:00:35 AM] Shardul Bansal: rejuvenate
[2024-06-14, 9:00:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: it’s better than operating at 20% because of the cuntiness
[2024-06-14, 9:01:12 AM] Shardul Bansal: take some serious time off, no rest like rest with ur gf
[2024-06-14, 9:01:48 AM] Shardul Bansal: Even rest with mom and dad isn’t that kinda rest, it’s good but they ask questions about whats next and whats ur plan etc etc
[2024-06-14, 9:02:20 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah exactly its chill with them to an extent but then the questions start
[2024-06-14, 9:02:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And in the mindset I am in, I will for sure start massive fights
[2024-06-14, 9:02:39 AM] Shardul Bansal: indeed
[2024-06-14, 9:02:40 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Might visit them for a long weekend or something
[2024-06-14, 9:02:44 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Get a minimal dose
[2024-06-14, 9:02:55 AM] Shardul Bansal: yea thats not motivating
[2024-06-14, 9:02:57 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah really feel drained and I doubt they would care anyways
[2024-06-14, 9:03:00 AM] Shardul Bansal: Exactly
[2024-06-14, 9:03:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Since I get no work or communication from anyone..
[2024-06-14, 9:03:10 AM] Shardul Bansal: fucken hell
[2024-06-14, 9:03:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: so far from ideal - u should pull the trigger on that month off
[2024-06-14, 9:04:35 AM] Shardul Bansal: itll also help with just seeing the big picture — not stuck in the nitty gritty here and now
[2024-06-14, 9:06:12 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah I think I just might
[2024-06-14, 9:06:33 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Theres no point in staying here and wasting away especially at the cost of mental wellbeing..
[2024-06-14, 9:06:52 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yep exactly, I could use the time to fully dedicate to apply to new jobs too tbh
[2024-06-14, 9:07:55 AM] Shardul Bansal: yea man, it’s freeing to start looking forward to your days and doing random walks and shit
[2024-06-14, 9:10:35 AM] Shardul Bansal: yea, that too but not worrying about that for a bit and just figuring out what’s next could be good to o
[2024-06-14, 9:12:38 AM] Rohan Bruvski: yeah exactly had a breakdown today when I was entering the office and dread mondays
[2024-06-14, 9:13:08 AM] Shardul Bansal: oh man that sucks im sorry to hear that 😔😭
[2024-06-14, 9:13:13 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Honestly I need less of this structure on me and have the ability to do me for a while and also apply on a full tine basis
[2024-06-14, 9:13:22 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah its really starting to affect me
[2024-06-14, 9:13:33 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Its the part where I constantly build and motivate myself
[2024-06-14, 9:13:50 AM] Rohan Bruvski: But I feel that is not a long term strategy as eventually even that fails
[2024-06-14, 9:14:00 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And now idk why I am here
[2024-06-14, 9:14:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Almost considering quitting and doing trading
[2024-06-14, 9:14:20 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Since that’s been going like a fucking ball this year
[2024-06-14, 9:14:42 AM] Shardul Bansal: it’s honestly impressive you’ve stuck it out for this long but there’s a part of your growth that environment stunts and a couple thousand bucks here and there even if FX is a bitch about holidays wont matter
[2024-06-14, 9:15:46 AM] Shardul Bansal: yea man, it’s time to start taking care of you, putting you and your needs before anything else
[2024-06-14, 9:16:04 AM] Shardul Bansal: why not?
[2024-06-14, 9:16:49 AM] Shardul Bansal: You might be able to make a few Gs doing this and looking for your next gig?
[2024-06-14, 9:19:08 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah honestly originally I was like what kinda message does this to send to the company
[2024-06-14, 9:19:18 AM] Rohan Bruvski: But now its obvious that they don’t give a flying fuck
[2024-06-14, 9:19:35 AM] Rohan Bruvski: And if they do then they don’t show it and can’t legally do anything against it
[2024-06-14, 9:19:40 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Passport bro
[2024-06-14, 9:19:58 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Already spent 9 months on this and feel like it could happen soon..
[2024-06-14, 1:12:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea, exactly
[2024-06-14, 1:12:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: are they taking the fund seriously still? Is the VC doing things properly to show they'll actually make it?
[2024-06-14, 1:13:03 PM] Shardul Bansal: yea fuck, this has been a battle and a half man, white people got it easy
[2024-06-15, 6:09:53 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Dude idk there is zero visibility in terms of how things are going
[2024-06-15, 6:10:14 AM] Rohan Bruvski: They've put all their eggs in one basket for a deal thst they have 30% chance of winning
[2024-06-15, 6:10:46 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Honestly white people really have it easy.. Zrinka didn't understand the concept of biometric collection for visas
[2024-06-15, 10:56:47 AM] Shardul Bansal: bruuuuh what happens if they don’t get it
[2024-06-15, 10:57:05 AM] Shardul Bansal: ahahaha yea i remember caroline was the same way when it came to visas
[2024-06-15, 3:17:57 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Idk not my concern
[2024-06-15, 3:18:10 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah white blonde girls live in a different world I feel
[2024-06-15, 3:18:35 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Btw got a doctors appointment tomorrow and gonna try to cop 3-4 weeks paid medical leave

[2024-07-11, 12:53:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: difficult problem to start a good network effect, buyers will not join a new marketplace just for an HVAC system, we explored the marketplace idea and dropped it quite quick
[2024-07-11, 12:53:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: the technician productivity tool is much more interesting
[2024-07-11, 12:53:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: that part i like
[2024-07-11, 1:46:34 PM] Rohan Bruvski: That's what I thought but they did 14m in rev last year in just Czechia, Poland and Germany
[2024-07-11, 1:47:13 PM] Rohan Bruvski: They haven't monetized it would be next step charging technicians a fee for the tool

[2024-09-03, 2:31:51 PM] Shardul Bansal: the problem in SF is that there's no aroused women here ever, they're all just chicks with dicks
[2024-09-03, 2:31:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: so the app would come up empty
[2024-09-04, 1:32:04 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Shanu repeat after me, there are no chicks with dicks, only men with tits..

[2024-09-16, 1:09:48 PM] Rohan Bruvski: ‎Voice call, ‎Answered on other device
[2024-09-16, 1:16:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: https://meet.google.com/qqt-euzs-zmv
[2024-09-18, 2:45:46 PM] Shardul Bansal: So I talked about some of the concerns/questions that I had with Alex Steele
* Ian Crosby (advisor) owns 5% of equity. Does he really bring $500k worth of value? According to Alex, he thinks that absolutely brings a tonne of legitimacy to the product. He’s also been able to make some stellar introductions and he gives the startup around 1-2 hours a day. His experience with previous startups is really useful and Ian is a close mentor/guide for Alex. 
* ⁠Why do agencies spend 1.5% already? Facebook, Google Ads only accept credit cards. So these are technically fees that Facebook and Google and all ad-hosters pay. If we have our own credit card, we make that spend from these large players when ad agencies pay for ads at these tech companies. He’s validated this with at least 30 different agencies already
* ⁠Do these agencies really need a branded card? Yes, now ad-attribution can be directly associated with the exact transaction they made. Closer relationship between actual sale and what the ad was if Opal (company) card is used. Plus, all invoicing, contracts can be done on the card, so this single financial product provides  payroll info, ad-attribution, invoicing, payment processing, contract generation all in one. That’s the big customer pain we’re solving. 
* ⁠The value for 418k SMB agencies in the world was pulled from https://www.statista.com/statistics/1454650/number-advertising-agencies-worldwide/#:~:text=As%20of%20January%2029%2C%202024,thousand%20agencies%20registered%20in%202023. It’s global. The reason he’s comfortable with that is because there’s already 2 european agencies using his product right now (he hasn’t marketed his product there at all) 
* ⁠The real competitors — yes, but no single competitor is covering all features like we are. They’re all building parts of the puzzle, which is why it was so easy to sign the initial customers
[2024-09-20, 5:25:38 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Sorry for the late reply have a nasty flu
[2024-09-20, 5:25:52 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Think the advisor 5% thing isn’t a huge concern, more the other guy eschewing equity for cash
[2024-09-20, 5:26:17 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Anyways too many points here for me to go through individually, lmk if you wanna have a call this weekend to go through these or have any doubts
[2024-09-20, 8:56:25 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh fuck that sucks, that time of the year 🫥

[2024-10-26, 10:42:47 AM] Shardul Bansal: Oh blessed
[2024-10-26, 11:19:33 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Seems like Air France over reacted maybe..
[2024-10-26, 11:20:07 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Anyways how's it going? Joined the new startup already?
[2024-10-26, 1:51:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: Yea? Hopefully that’s it
[2024-10-26, 1:52:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: I have! No contract signed but technically working 🤷‍♂️👀
[2024-10-26, 3:05:41 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Oh what is the contract just a formality
[2024-10-26, 3:07:35 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Or is he outsourcing Indian BPOs to SF Indians lol
[2024-10-26, 7:32:28 PM] Shardul Bansal: kind of, we’ve negotiated equity and salary so should be good on that front, he just incorporated this week
[2024-10-26, 7:33:25 PM] Shardul Bansal: aaahahah what’s a BPO?
[2024-10-26, 11:27:09 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Ahhh chill so it's all just being signed through! How much equity did you get
[2024-10-26, 11:27:25 PM] Rohan Bruvski: BPO is what made India attractive to US companies
[2024-10-26, 11:28:04 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Business processing outsourced aka what made Infosys big
[2024-10-27, 12:19:10 AM] Shardul Bansal: 1%!
[2024-10-27, 12:19:23 AM] Shardul Bansal: i felt like it was fair!
[2024-10-27, 12:19:44 AM] Shardul Bansal: ahhhh
[2024-10-27, 1:36:21 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Yeah not bad
[2024-10-27, 1:36:39 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hope there aren't too many funding rounds to dilute your esop
[2024-10-27, 1:36:46 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Will you guys raise money?
[2024-10-27, 11:25:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: dont think so, not for a bit
[2024-10-29, 5:01:32 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Hey dude
[2024-10-29, 5:01:50 AM] Rohan Bruvski: For some reason the OTP code didn't work again and dude went back with Dad's watch
[2024-10-29, 5:02:11 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Do you think you can cancel the order? I'll just order it directly from here again
[2024-10-29, 6:41:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: Ahhhh shit, ok, i get the otp for the delivery at 11 pm, it will work tomorrow
[2024-10-29, 6:41:38 AM] Shardul Bansal: I will give you guys the right otp
[2024-10-29, 6:41:45 AM] Shardul Bansal: It changes everytime
[2024-10-29, 6:55:44 AM] Rohan Bruvski: How are you sure man
[2024-10-29, 6:55:56 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Guy has come and gone thrice already
[2024-10-29, 6:56:05 AM] Rohan Bruvski: Feels like some systemic issue
[2024-10-29, 12:28:12 PM] Shardul Bansal: No, i keep giving the OTP of the day before
[2024-10-29, 12:28:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: Every single delivery day has an otp, but normally im asleep by the time the next day otp comes
[2024-10-29, 12:28:34 PM] Shardul Bansal: Not today

[2024-10-29, 12:55:41 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Think you'll need to generate the OTP in real time
[2024-10-29, 12:55:49 PM] Shardul Bansal: Really?
[2024-10-29, 12:56:09 PM] Rohan Bruvski: I mean will the OTP from 11pm work here?
[2024-10-29, 12:56:18 PM] Shardul Bansal: I think it should, yes
[2024-10-29, 12:56:31 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Think it's a bit risky
[2024-10-29, 12:56:44 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Do you mind if I just call you when guy is here?
[2024-10-29, 12:57:02 PM] Rohan Bruvski: Need thst package tomorrow otherwise dad won't have it on his bday
[2024-10-29, 12:58:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: I’ve received 3 OTPs so far and they’re at 11 PM and 11:34 PM. I’m betting this one is also going to come at that time
[2024-10-29, 12:58:11 PM] Shardul Bansal: go ahead, yea, call!
[2024-10-29, 12:58:17 PM] Shardul Bansal: makes sense

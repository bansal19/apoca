1) Understand codebases for autoeval SAEs/Getting activations so I can refactor 
2) Plan out the validation thing better - exact vertical where it might be valuable, tag a vertical kinda thing or if vertical, how does the workflow even work for integrating it
3) prompt test more models with my safety framework to get some results
[2025-01-04, 3:03:17 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: https://x.com/bubblemaps/status/1875528812395688209?t=tXkFJK6Nft6GCczwMcwL7A&s=08

[2025-01-04, 10:19:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: so these are all frameworks to create ur own agents
[2025-01-04, 10:20:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: they say agents but really they mean twitter bots, which are just language models with capabilities to post, not a tonne of agentic behaviour outside of that
[2025-01-04, 10:22:20 PM] Shardul Bansal: ai16z and virtuals are huge,
[2025-01-04, 10:22:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: lotta people use those frameworks to create twitter bots
[2025-01-04, 10:22:44 PM] Shardul Bansal: all part of the dead internet theory
[2025-01-04, 10:26:14 PM] Shardul Bansal: the thread is kinda wrong cus most of these agents aren’t “owned” by these companies
[2025-01-04, 10:26:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: O
[2025-01-04, 10:26:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: What about goat?

[2025-01-05, 5:18:16 AM] Shardul Bansal: i think of the crypto aspect separately, it’s just a way for people to bet which will go big
[2025-01-05, 5:18:33 AM] Shardul Bansal: kinda like the thing marco was working on for musicians
[2025-01-05, 6:10:14 AM] Shardul Bansal: the one that provides utility with crypto is truth terminal, that’s really interesting
[2025-01-05, 6:10:52 AM] Shardul Bansal: marc andressen sent it like 10k in bitcoin to spread the word of goatsee, a new religion they invented
[2025-01-05, 2:30:24 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bruh wt lmao

2) Implement Matryoshka-SAEs and train one
3) Get additional insights on how prompt optimization currently is being used in cos OR establish a better thought process on how prompt engineering as a science might look like

3) start one M-SAE training by this weekend 

4) Complete Anthropic coding interview II

5) Prepare for cerebras interview I

6) write one growth hack content on X (Why does XYZ prompt work) (A little X consumption only related to this is OK)

7) start either the auto-devrel OR the auto-information consumption platform in a substantial way. This means atleast making one integration that is able to digest information from XYZ website.

[2025-01-21, 2:27:52 PM] Shardul Bansal: know anyone that is cracked at bio/ml and can help?
[2025-01-21, 2:28:15 PM] Shardul Bansal: if u help me find their next hire, we’ll both make $4k USD each
[2025-01-21, 2:35:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: She didn't respond to angel investment, i am not helping lol
[2025-01-21, 2:35:31 PM] Shardul Bansal: ur not serious right
[2025-01-21, 2:35:34 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I am a simple man
[2025-01-21, 2:35:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: dude why are u like this
[2025-01-21, 2:35:43 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Wdym
[2025-01-21, 2:35:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: they prolly closed their round
[2025-01-21, 2:35:59 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: If u want my help let me angel invest it's pretty simple bro not that complex
[2025-01-21, 2:36:03 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Why would I help
[2025-01-21, 2:36:10 PM] Shardul Bansal: for 4k USD
[2025-01-21, 2:36:16 PM] Shardul Bansal: that’s why u’d help
[2025-01-21, 2:36:19 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I have like so many ppz that I angel invest in and need ml engs, would rather help them
[2025-01-21, 2:36:45 PM] Shardul Bansal: how much were u going to invest
[2025-01-21, 2:37:08 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Idk bro but why'd I help anyone that ghosts me uk right?
[2025-01-21, 2:37:18 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Like it's disrespectful, no is also ok
[2025-01-21, 2:37:36 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: The money is secondary, this isn't how business is done
[2025-01-21, 2:37:40 PM] Shardul Bansal: she’s horrendous at texting, keeps her phone off most of the time, most texts slip through
[2025-01-21, 2:39:32 PM] Shardul Bansal: can u not be a petty lil bitch
[2025-01-21, 2:39:51 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I disagree this isn't being a petty lil bitch, it's principle
[2025-01-21, 2:40:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: nah, it’s ego and pettiness
[2025-01-21, 2:40:33 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No, it's principle. Otherwise I am doing wrong with all the people who believe in me and who I help and who let me help them ✅
[2025-01-21, 2:41:56 PM] Shardul Bansal: i ask how much u were going to invest because when she closed a 4 mil round, I’m guessing she found it hard to see the value u were going to provide. You know this but there’s fewer good founders than there is money in the valley. If you’re really interested in angel investing in them, you should give her a call.
[2025-01-21, 2:42:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: How are you doing wrong with all the people who believe in you?
[2025-01-21, 2:43:01 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Because they let me invest and/or are respectful, I help them. You can't back out earlier and then expect me to help later bro
[2025-01-21, 2:43:21 PM] Shardul Bansal: All i’m saying is, her not answering is nothing personal, she’s just horrendous at keeping track of this stuff, especially during the time when they were raising, that was super busy for them, she showed me her calendar.
[2025-01-21, 2:43:59 PM] Shardul Bansal: it was like 15-20 calls a day
[2025-01-21, 2:44:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: I followed up 2-3* bro, uk I try to be as helpful but I don't see why I need to help someone who never followed up with me
[2025-01-21, 2:44:22 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Doesn't make sense
[2025-01-21, 2:44:33 PM] Shardul Bansal: I see
[2025-01-21, 2:44:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: even after following up she didn’t respond?
[2025-01-21, 2:44:57 PM] Shardul Bansal: dang
[2025-01-21, 2:49:13 PM] Shardul Bansal: Also - my goals for this week - 
1. Finish up the core staking to a validator functionality in the wallet. This will then involve sending work to frontend engineers to properly release the product before dTao
2. Explore dtao in testnet, play around with it and get familiar with the inner workings of it.
3. Get dtao market simulator up and running.
4. Continue de-risking Kernel secure enclave subnet idea.
[2025-01-21, 2:50:58 PM] Shardul Bansal: Last week I only completed 2 out of the 4 tasks, going to nail all 4 this week 💪
[2025-01-21, 2:51:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: what’re ur goals? You wanna continue these? 
Goals for this week:

1) No social media consumption on X, YT (consumption here means reading/watching content, publishing is fine)

2) Finish the contract negotiation with the healthtech/medical devices startup for the contracting role.

3) start one M-SAE training by this weekend 

4) Complete Anthropic coding interview II

5) Prepare for cerebras interview I

6) write one growth hack content on X (Why does XYZ prompt work) (A little X consumption only related to this is OK)

7) start either the auto-devrel OR the auto-information consumption platform in a substantial way. This means atleast making one integration that is able to digest information from XYZ website.
[2025-01-21, 3:04:15 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Still have to decide goals
[2025-01-21, 3:04:17 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Ill lyk

[2025-01-27, 8:21:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: ### 

1. Move staking functionality to use RPC instead of legacy code
2. Come up with plan of attack for wallet execution. We should have a date-for-date for completion
    1. This might involve sending to existing code to away team to finalise
3. Read and understand dtao paper when it’s released by OTF
[2025-01-27, 8:27:51 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Damn all crypto shit huh

[2025-01-27, 8:28:24 PM] Shardul Bansal: that could be huge
[2025-01-27, 8:28:37 PM] Shardul Bansal: but it needs to be tested for some time
[2025-01-27, 8:28:48 PM] Shardul Bansal: some chances are that nothing happens
[2025-01-27, 8:28:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: but im hoping that’s not the case

[2025-01-27, 8:31:54 PM] Shardul Bansal: just tell me

[2025-02-19, 10:47:30 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Yeah we should, no need to add $$ back
[2025-02-19, 10:47:40 AM] Shardul Bansal: let’s do the $$
[2025-02-19, 10:47:54 AM] Shardul Bansal: u fell off without the $$
[2025-02-19, 10:48:26 AM] Shardul Bansal: let’s up it to $30 USD
[2025-02-19, 10:48:27 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: No I am good without the $$
[2025-02-19, 10:48:28 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Mostly because goals change
[2025-02-19, 10:51:02 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Lol no dude I am not doing $s
[2025-02-19, 10:51:06 AM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: It's harmful for productivity if I need to change goals
[2025-02-19, 1:06:55 PM] Shardul Bansal: im not saying u cant change
[2025-02-19, 1:07:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: just send the new goals
[2025-02-19, 1:07:20 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Bro I just want to execute it's too much overhead
[2025-02-19, 1:07:28 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Maybe we can do time accountability
[2025-02-19, 1:07:33 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Work XYZ number of hours
[2025-02-19, 1:07:50 PM] Shardul Bansal: nah id rather focus on output rather than time at desk
[2025-02-19, 1:08:11 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Obviously not time at desk but time spent doing actual work
[2025-02-19, 1:26:35 PM] Shardul Bansal: even that is hard, let’s do goals without the money
[2025-02-19, 1:26:51 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: Okay
[2025-02-19, 1:29:41 PM] Akshaj Jain SF roommate: My goals for this week:

1) Do atleast 50 outreaches for the devrel product (Try to get atleast 10 beta clients) 
2) See how devrel works for a few demos and see where its lacking and where it should go
3) Extract more reddit data than December 2024 and start finishing up the vibe eval paper
4) Spend atleast 2 hours thinking about where roads lead and what I want to actually do next

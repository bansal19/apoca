[2021-05-10, 12:08:09 PM] Mumma: I believe your Son called and spoke to Hetvi that he is hesitant to hire a consultant.

[2021-05-10, 1:32:19 PM] Shardul Bansal: They’re not giving any information, I have to book a consultation with a lawyer which is 300 CAD and then I can ask questions
[2021-05-10, 1:33:08 PM] Shardul Bansal: Honestly, this entire process seems very doable and it doesn’t really make any sense to seek someone’s help. I will call Hetvi tomorrow to ask about the border service she was talking about
[2021-05-10, 1:33:48 PM] Mumma: And ask her if you need to collect it physically
[2021-05-10, 1:34:01 PM] Shardul Bansal: Ok, I will do that
[2021-05-10, 1:34:23 PM] Mumma: Dont know if its sane as study permit, for that bio metrics was required

[2021-05-16, 5:43:24 AM] Mumma: Daddy and me were trying to figure out for Monaco trip

[2021-08-29, 2:09:59 PM] Mumma: *Day 1* 

Welcome to DAY 1 of the 21 day abundance challenge by 
*Deepak Chopra* !

Every day the biggest challenge will be that you need to go beyond your boundaries. We will support each other  with our presence and with the fact that we are all in this together.  

Set your intention that you will be able to complete these challenges given during the next 21 days.

There will be ups and downs and times you will need to push through more. Just ride the wave and trust that everything that happens will be harmonious and we will grow both individually and as a group. 

Thanks again for being here 🙏

*#" Today’s excerise"#*

Make a list of 50 people who have influenced your life in any way- big or small. It could be a word someone said, a book, a teaching...anyway someone has influenced your life.

Dive through your life and bring those people in.

Write down the name of the person who touched or influenced you and the circumstance.

Immediately after this message, I will send the link for today’s meditation and mantra. It will take more or less 15 minutes. Make sure you’re giving yourself enough focused time, in a quiet, peaceful space to listen to it 😊
[2021-08-29, 2:11:22 PM] Mumma: *Day 2*

Welcome to day 2 of the abundance challenge! 

Today’s task is to write a list of people in your family and social circle that you feel have achieved their goals in life and are happy.

The goals can be in terms of any one or more aspects of their life.... career, health, time, learning etc. You feel they have achieved their goals and are happy.

It doesn’t matter how many people are on your list.

Today’s inspirational quote: *Learning from mistakes is a great lesson for growth.* 

Be sure to make the appropriate sacred space needed to let the energies anchored within you.

Remember to let the group know when you have completed today’s task.

Please note that this assignment #2🌟 also to be completed *Within 24 hours* 

Love 💖
Caroline

[2023-01-22, 7:07:04 PM] Shardul Bansal: My bullshit alarm is going through the roof for this, this does not make any sense to me. You can’t judge the health of “47” different systems and organs through electrodes. My suggestion is if you are able to try it for free and it’s not an invasive procedure, you can give it a try but otherwise I would stay away from this
[2023-01-22, 7:08:39 PM] Shardul Bansal: The website looked like the biggest red flag, none of their sentences are coherent or make any sense, they’re using big words for the sake of big words

What a beautiful weather!
[2023-06-13, 3:11:30 PM] Mumma: Hi Shardul, thanks for the information. 9 is actually a better time because we can’t shoot after dark because portraiture is not good after dark. Hope that’s ok?

For the location, Louvre and Eiffel Tower is too far apart for 1 hour. I recommend Bir Hakeim bridge. The bridge is beautiful, it has an excellent view of the Eiffel Tower and you can also go to Port debilly which is a walk along the river Seine.
[2023-06-13, 3:11:30 PM] Mumma: Let me send all finer details below…

[2023-11-11, 4:06:07 AM] Mumma: 🌆 Reflecting on the incredible journey of Dubai 🚀

As I gaze upon this picture, it's hard not to draw parallels between Dubai as a land of opportunities  and my own personal and professional growth. Dubai, a city that has risen  to become a global hub of innovation and opportunity, mirrors the transformative journey we all embark on in our expansion!

Just as Dubai has evolved into a symbol of ambition, diversity, and progress, my career has seen its own share of milestones and challenges. From the first steps I took in my professional journey to the heights I've reached today, it's been a remarkable adventure.

Dubai's iconic Burj Khalifa, touching the sky, reminds me that the sky is not the limit; it's just the beginning. we should continuously aim higher and never stop pursuing our goals.

I'm truly grateful for  the connections I've made, and the opportunities I've seized in this city of dreams. Here's to embracing change, pursuing growth, and scaling new heights – in our careers and in life!

[2024-10-26, 7:33:00 PM] Shardul Bansal: जो कामयाब होने वाला है,
मुश्किलें उसकी जिंदगी का हिस्सा हैं,
और जो कामयाब हो चुका है,
मुश्किलें उसकी ज़िंदगी का किस्सा हैं।
जी हां,ये बात एक कामयाब इंसान के अपने जीवन के गौरवपूर्ण 60 वर्ष सफलतापूर्वक व्यतीत करने वाले दीपक पर खरी उतरती है।हम जिस चेहरे के साथ जन्म लेते है वह हमारे बस में नहीं होता मगर जिस चरित्र,व्यक्तित्व एवं किरदार के साथ हम बड़े होते हैं उसके लिए हम खुद जिम्मेदार होते हैं।दीपक ने वास्तव में अपना रास्ता अपनी मंजिल बहुत बड़ी चुनी पर फिर उसे पाने के लिए खूब मेहनत, लगन से मंजिल तक पहुंचने तक रुकना नही है,ये ठान लिया और फिर अपनी समझदारी,निष्ठा,कर्मठता से कामयाबी की बुलंदियों को छू लिया।परमात्मा कभी भाग्य नही लिखता,जीवन के हर कदम पर हमारी सोच हमारा व्यवहार एवं हमारे कर्म ही हमारा भाग्य लिखते हैं और ये दीपक ने अपने सद्कर्मों से अपने भाग्य को स्वयं लिख कर सिद्ध किया है।एक समझदार पति,एक गुरु समान शिक्षा देने वाला पिता,प्यार और ध्यान रखने वाला भाई का किरदार भी बहुत ही खूबसूरती से निभाया है।जीवन के कई झंझावातों से गुजरते हुए अपनी प्रतिभा से अपने बच्चों को भी उनकी मंजिल का रास्ता बता दिया है,जीवन के 50 से 60 वर्ष का समय बहुत ही चुनौती और जिम्मेदारियों से भरा होता है,दीपक ने अपनी सूझबूझ अपनी असीम ऊर्जा से इस चुनौती का सफलता पूर्वक सामना करते हुए अपने परिवार को आगे बढ़ाया है।कठिनाइयों से जूझते हुए स्वर्ग जैसे वातावरण का निर्माण वास्तव में जीवन की उपलब्धि है।वास्तव में इन सब उपलब्धियों के लिए दीपक बधाई के पात्र हैं।
एक अमेरिकी लेखक ने अपनी पुस्तक 2nd mountain में  बहुत अच्छा सुझाव दिया है कि इंसान को अपने जीवन के एक पर्वत शिखर पर पहुंचने के पश्चात एक दूसरे पर्वत शिखर पर पहुंचने के बारे में भी सोचना चाहिए अर्थात अब जीवन में कुछ सकून देने वाले अवसरों की खोज,कुछ अपने बारे में भी सोचना,मन की शांति आदि के बारे में भी सोचना चाहिए और ये कोई स्वार्थपरता नही है।बहुत कमा खा लिया है अब शांति से वन की ओर चलने की कोशिश करनी चाहिए,दीपक में ओर भी कई प्रतिभा है,लेखन में उसकी बहुत रुचि है और अच्छा लिखने की क्षमता भी है तो इस और भी ध्यान दिया जा सकता है,कुछ धार्मिक,सामाजिक कार्यों में भी भाग लिया जा सकता है आदि आदि।वैसे आने वाले समय में अभी कई सुखद मोड़ दीपक तुम्हारी प्रतीक्षा कर रहे हैं।अभी रोहन,शार्दुल की शादी फिर तुम्हारा और लीना का दादा दादी बनना और बच्चों में अपना बचपन खोजना आदि।दीपक का जन्मदिन एक बहुत ही सुखद संयोग है कि यह हमेशा दिवाली के दिन या आस पास ही पड़ता है,यानी हर जन्मदिन दिवाली ही दिवाली।हमारे लिए तो एक दीपक ही काफी है आनेवाली सभी दीवालियों की रोशनियों के लिए।
अंत में झिलमिल रोशनी में निवेदित उमंगों के आलोक में अविरल शुभकामनाएं।
हर तमन्ना आपकी दहलीज पर दस्तक दे,
हर फूल आपके आंगन में खिले,
आपका सफर हो इतना हसीन,
हर खुशी आपके साथ चले।

[2025-01-17, 9:15:18 PM] Mumma: “ *Saturday Musings* “ 

Beer is warm !

Last weekend, I had a chance to sit quietly, sipping my beer and replay the highlights ‘what did I do ‘ last year  on my memory silver screen. 

The little wins, the little defeats, the little gains, the little losses, the little appreciations, the little criticisms.

Whats common across all is the word “Little”.

I have observed that what you are not capable of, you can’t even think and if you can think it you are capable of it.

I live such a small life. Such little impact. One day as we all will, I will disappear and what difference is my presence making that my absence would point to?

This man disturbs me. This Elon Musk chap. Is he even real? One moment he makes a beauty of an electric car, gets houses off the grid, then he goes to build NASA single handedly dreaming of putting human consciousness on Mars, then he builds Starlink satellites giving internet to the worlds most remote areas, the chap build humanoid robot Optimus while building Neuralink that will give human brain the power to control devices with thoughts while building The Boring company that is reimagining transportation to decongest our cities. Seed funded what became ChatGPT - was unhappy with outcome so built Grok his own AI Chatbot. In his free time bought Twitter and since he had more free time, got into politics.

In between this he found time to marry thrice and have twelve children!

We have an escape valve to make ourself feel not bad - we will say he is a Genius. Its not our fault we aren’t. Those getting worked up on Narayan Murthy 70 hour work advice - I suggest don’t even bother to check what Musk work hours are. Insane. 

Whats really hit me is his question to Parag Agrawal the CEO of Twitter he fired. In a public spat with him he asked him, “What have you got done last week?”

For some reason, this has got stuck within my head. What have I got done last year?

The trick here is not what we did, we the mediocre measure our life by what we did, the outstanding ones measure their life by what got done. 

What I got done in a week would be too embarrassing so I thought a year is a long enough time frame. 

Well, it didn’t change the embarrassment. What have I really accomplished last year year? 

Little wins, little improvements, little highs - is all I can boast off. 

Most of us live ordinary lives, somehow we entertain ourselves by believing making money, buying expensive toys and having your pictures splashed in media are accomplishments.

How ordinary it is! 

In my growing up years, I knew just one thing, I don’t want to live an ordinary life. A mediocre life that doesn’t count for anything. The measure of a life is the impact it has on others. Is our life reducing human pain or furthering human progress? If not it’s an ordinary life. 

Yet all I have to stake claim to are the “little” accomplishments that under our microscopic lens we blow them up to fool ourselves.

If you have the courage to be brutally honest - at least to yourself, ask yourself - so what have you got done in your life so far?

Cheers

[2025-03-04, 7:41:48 PM] Mumma: "I have always supported both of my children’s decisions, no matter what they were, because their happiness is my happiness. Our family has always been open with one another, and that openness has been our greatest strength—especially in times of crisis.

I understand that for Zrinka, living alone and being in a long-distance relationship may have reached a breaking point. In the past, the way she received abrupt news might have deeply affected her. At the same time, I know that she hasn’t yet had much exposure to the world or an international environment, even though she has loved someone from a different background.

What I’m saying has nothing to do with a job interview but everything to do with relationships. Knowing your partner well means standing by them, communicating with openness, and being vulnerable when needed. In the future, you will need to take her along on this journey—not just through words, but through the art of understanding.
I want both of u to be happy together ❤️
